2,Place your bets: will Trump be removed by force from the White House?,"We already know Trump will not attend Biden's inaugeration. But the real question is: will the recently fired ex-president vacate the White House before Biden moves in?

Suppose Trump doesn't leave. Will he physically barricade himself in the building? Will there be n hours-long stand-off? Will Biden order the National Guard to forcibly evict the Trump family from the premises? Will Trump be led out in handcuffs, or perhaps on a stretcher?

The last two months of American history have proven to be the wildly stupid and pants-shittingly terrifying events in a generation. Anything can happen.

I am wagering 1000 internet points that Trump does not vacate the White House on Inauguration day.

3,Have you ever gotten conservatives to rethink their political views from a conversation?,"I’m had both positive/negative conversations from conservatives talking to them on political chat rooms and such 

My most negative one came from a chat room I checked out today which was mostly full of Trump conservatives basically I was met with the typical conservative talking points like, “Democrats are the real racists” “Trump is not a racist he did this for African Americans” “David Duke/Baked Alaska are on the left because they voted for Biden/Yang” “Academia indoctrinated you” “Nazis were leftists it says socialists” needless to say, talking to them was like talking to a bunch of zombies that drunk too much Trump koolaid and it seriously made me lose my brain cells. The only good thing that came out of the group was them condemning a women who said ch*** virus. 
   On the other hand, I’ve spoken to conservatives where we had a great conversation and some of them thanked me for my perspective and even understood where I was coming from and were willing to listen and also explain their point of view like mature adults.",AskALiberal,1610942080

10,There's a lot of speculation about what direction the GOP can go post-Trump. Are there any Republicans and/or prominent conservatives active right now that you would like to see as a future model for the party to follow?,"What elected Republicans or prominent self-identified conservatives do you think offer the best model forward for the Republican Party to adopt? And by ""follow"" I don't mean someone they appear blindly beholden to or anything of that sort. Simply someone whose platform or beliefs that you feel would shape the Republican Party in to something you would respect, even if you don't agree with the views exactly, and/or someone you think would change the GOP for the better electorally while dropping the whole ""MAGA/this was a fraud election and sham impeachment/Trump 2024"" shtick. 

And I understand that this subreddit is /r/askaliberal, so it might appear strange I'm asking this here, but originally I was going to ask ""How do you feel the GOP should change?"" but everytime I have asked a liberal this they basically describe what sounds to me like a ""Democratic Party 2"" rather than something that reforms the GOP while maintaining its right-of-center identity.

15,Is California still more conservative than any other developed country?,"Some people complain California is too liberal but it seems economically it is more right wing compared to any other developed country.

Canada, Western Europe, New Zealand, etc. seem obviously more progressive than California 

But even less obvious examples like Turkey, Argenina, Bulgaria, etc. have free university, maternity leave, paid holiday, labor protections, subsidized benefits etc. 

tldr; Even the most liberal state is still more conservative than any other developed country?",AskALiberal,1610919744
16,How do you manage discussions with conservatives?,"I recently had a discussion with a conservative on r/askconservatives. During that discussion we hit upon the subject of  the ""Big Lie."" For those of you who are unfamiliar with the term, it is a propaganda technique that entails telling a lie so big that it can convince so many people who would think that there is no one who would tell a lie so huge unless it was true. The term ""Big Lie"" was popularized after a excerpt from Mein Kompf where Hitler referenced a big lie that he alleged German Jews were guilty of telling in their defense against the ""Stab in the Back"" mythology.

I am of the opinion that Trump's election farce is the Big Lie of American politics. Now, I could be wrong about that but it does qualify as a ""Big Lie."" My opponent couldn't get over the fact that I was in any way comparing any of Trump's actions to a Nazi's, specifically Hitler. 

Now my educational background is in Political Science and International Relations. I attended a university in the US with a top 50 International Affairs department and I graduated with honors. I'm not trying to brag but I was sure that I was couching my assessment in the writings of such thinkers like Hannah Arendt and Timothy Snyder. I am open to the possibility of being wrong, but I can't help but despair at the inability of conservatives to see what is in plain sight. Timothy Snyder, in recent NYT piece, stated that ""post-truth is pre-fascism."" For what its worth, I agree.

Do any of you agree? Was my approach to this discussion wrong? I'm looking for criticism.

I've attached a link to the original thread for those who are interested.

are there other examples that I can point to?",AskALiberal,1610910838
18,What's your personal understanding of how the Equal Protection clause and related laws work?,"That area of law is confusing, since the drinking age isn't equal protection, women's and men's only schools exist, Affirmative Action exists, and certain business licenses and contracts can be set aside for women and minority owned businesses. Etc. But Oregon can't make a Black only COVID relief fund and a state can't make different drinking ages for men and women.

It's a stupid question, I'm confused about it, but I want to have a further understanding of it so that things make more sense. I understand and support the reasons for them and I recognize the historic need for them, I'm just confused about it because I can't wrap my head around that area of law and I want to understand it. 

I tried googling it, but I still don't understand how the 14th amendment's strict and intermediate scrutiny work, nor how other things like the civil rights act fit into all of it.

So without conservative bullshit and rambling about how it's ""unfair"", how would you offer an easy to understand explanation (or as easy to understand as possible) if something is allowed or not under that area of law so I can finally understand it and not be confused?",AskALiberal,1610909923
19,How do we prepare now for the mass migrations that will be caused by climate change?,"In the US, there will be radical shifts of people moving both in the country and out of it. With constant wildfires decimating the West with consistent droughts and draining water supplies, the West will become inhospitable over time, namely California and Arizona. Hurricanes and rising sea levels will force many leaving on the Atlantic coast to higher ground.

Globally, it appears that climate change will force peoples north or south from the equator as that region becomes more inhospitable. Noted is the Saharan desert and Middle East, with dwindling resources, namely water. These peoples wouldn't migrate en masse, but I do think it is the US's job to provide haven to these peoples.

I imagine there will be hundred of peoples moving to more hospitable regions before the end of the century. Populations will become more dense, namely along the east coast of the USA and we need to prepare now for this migration.",AskALiberal,1610908732

30,How does the Rescue America Plan help ensure small businesses can handle paying the $15/hour during a depressed economy?,"I’m just curious on why not push for a higher minimum wage when the economy is an actual recovery and not under the stranglehold of the economy.

And just to add to that, why is the $15/hour minimum wage not tied to annual Cost of living increases or to at least inflation? Tying it to average median wage isn’t as helpful since median wages haven’t kept up with inflation.

If there isn’t targeted aid to small businesses (many of which are the same businesses struggling the most rn), the cost ends up going to the customer which will result in lower demand.

Longitudinal studies have shown increasing minimum wage does not come at the permanent loss of millions of jobs. However, shorter studies that look across months to one year indicate that increasing minimum does result in some loss of jobs as the market readjusts.",AskALiberal,1610867286

At the same time, they struggle to get the needed capital within the country (though they can get it from foreign investors). Should governments developing countries subsidize their industry to help them compete and even get the capital to start? I mean factories could get foreign capital (in principle anyways) but direct investment on the part of the government could help a country industrialize no? Is that a good or bad policy and if so why?

Also, I'm just talking developing countries here not like Canada or Austria or New Zealand. They are already wealthy and have plenty of capital and highly competitive factories compared to developing countries.

I also saw another post on this subreddit asking about such changes but I can’t find it and it wasn’t the main focus of that post anyways. The OP of that post was deeply afraid of Section 14(c) being revoked 

My personal thought is this is bad unless there are mechanisms put in place to replace it. My reasoning is some people with disabilities are factually so unproductive that they can not produce 15$/hr and thus even good intending businesses/corporations wouldn’t be able to justify employing such people at that level of compensation. This is also considering there are people with such disabilities actively wanting a job because it gives good feelings, a social life/environment, and some disposable income.",AskALiberal,1610830061

44,Can we talk about how significant racial resentment is among the Trump base and how it is driving the extremism we see?,"It isn’t just conspiracy theories and misinformation motivating Trump’s base, these are deeply ingrained feelings that should be analyzed and studied much more. 

The foundation of Trumpism was always racial anxiety. Various studies have shown that racial resentment drew voters to Trump initially , it was more significant than economics according to polls. There is another theory that Trump’s win was a backlash against the black President in office. Trump used the birther movement conspiracy as a racist attempt to discredit Obama’s position. 

Trump’s racist language and policies  throughout the years satisfied his supporters. Their support was always consistent because it matched their views of minority groups.

Now that Trump is gone, it is a “loss” for whiteness in their minds. The wild conspiracy theories helps them rationalize their underlying fear of white people losing power in America. It is a more extreme version of the birther movement. 

I would even venture to say that the rejection of Biden’s win is an attempt to invalidate the large numbers of black voters who helped Biden win in key states. 

This is legacy of the southern strategy.

45,How do you view notions of Fairness?,"A book I recently read pointed out that a fundamental difference between Liberals vs Conservatives is the notion of Fairness-- especially as it relates to jobs &amp; the economy.

The author's assertion was that a liberal views fairness from the perspective that everyone should be given an equal economic opportunity regardless of their socio-economic background. Whereas, the author asserted, that a conservative views fairness as anyone deserving the economic benefits produced from their work. 

The difference between these two notions of fairness can have all sorts of political implications in terms of how laws are written, etc.

48,"What are your thoughts on rational basis review, strict scrutiny, etc?","I asked myself what would piss off Trump supporters the most. So I asked a now deleted question on reddit about a hypothetical situation involving the federal government creating a single payer universal healthcare system, yearly stimulus and higher minimum wage that only include Women and People of Color.

I ended up deleting it because it turns out it's a terrible and boring question because none of that passes the 14th amendment. I asked myself why that doesn't but things like affirmative action and the drinking age do. And after a bit of googling I was introduced to the topics of Strict Scrutiny and Rational Basis Review. 

Essentialy, it means that laws that don't provide equal protection need to have no other alternative or possible way of achieving the positive effect they're creating. 

Affirmative action is only allowed because the government hit a dead end in wanting to make institutions more diverse, so they allow it because it's the only possible way to achieve what they want to achieve (and even that's been trimmed down since it was first instituted).

The same goes for why reparations for groups of people are constitutional. The goal is to increase the wealth of the group, and you can't really do that without directly giving them wealth. 

Meanwhile a Minority Universal Healthcare System, a yearly Minority Stimulus, and Minority Minimum Wage that only include Women and People of Color would just be discriminatory because the discriminatory nature is added as an extra thing and there's no point to doing it when you can easily give it to the entire population. 

Because even if a group of people is more behind when it comes to socioeconomic standing, if it's possible to not discriminate and make the program universal then it has to be universal.

At least this is my understanding after reading a fair bit of google. Correct me if I'm wrong and you notice any inaccuracies or incorrect things.


* Do you agree with the very narrow system of strict scrutiny, or do you think that it's too narrow and prevents there from being more possibilities for making an equal society?

* Do you think if there was more awareness of strict scrutiny, there would be less Trump type republicans since there would be less sociocultural anxiety?",AskALiberal,1610814955

And if gender is a social construct...

Ik that not every liberal believes it is and I have other reasons as to why I don’t think it is but this is a big one. Study’s show that young boys gravitate to male toys like trucks and females gravitate to girl toys like dolls.

&gt; The highly contagious variant of the coronavirus first seen in the United Kingdom will become the dominant strain in the United States within about two months, its rapid spread heightening the urgency of getting people vaccinated, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention predicted Friday in its most sobering warning yet about mutations in the virus. 

&gt; the U.K. strain, which British researchers estimate is roughly 50 percent more transmissible than the more common coronavirus strain, will account for a majority of cases in the United States by some point in March.

&gt;The CDC released modeling data to back up its forecast showing a rapid spike in infections linked to the U.K. strain. The agency said the emergence of these mutation-laden variants requires greater efforts to limit viral spread — immediately, even before the U.K. variant becomes commonplace.

&gt;So far, no variant is known to cause more severe illness, although more infections would inevitably mean a higher death toll overall, as the CDC made clear in an informational graphic released Friday: “MORE SPREAD — MORE CASES — MORE DEATHS,” it said.

&gt;The CDC report “speaks to the urgency of getting vaccines out. It’s now a race against the virus,” said William Hanage, an epidemiologist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.

&gt;Scientists both in and out of government have stressed the need for the public to stick to proven methods of limiting viral spread, such as wearing a mask, social distancing, avoiding crowds and having good hand hygiene.

Black people should all stay in Africa, Asians in Asia and Europe should be purely white.

The GOP moves away from Trumpism and becomes more centre right, rather than far right, keeping the capitalism but ditching the more extreme rhetoric. I see this leading to the Democratic party continuing its leftward shift.

OTOH if the Republican party stays Trumpy, then there will be some some Lincoln Project republicans that will switch to the democratic party, pulling it back to the centre.

Throughout all this, of course, there will be factionalism in the democratic party which will probably shake out in some direction regardless of what happens to the GOP.

29,What do you think the state of the US will be in by the end of summer 2021?,"May seem like an odd question to ask, but it’s one that I think of a lot these days. I’m currently 20 years old, and still live with my parents because I’m employed part-time at our family business, and I’ve finished two semesters of college in Pennsylvania (I live in Texas). In wake of recent events, my utterly idiotic father (I don’t use those terms loosely, the man believes in QAnon, in my book that automatically renders your opinions of the world worthless) has been a major fucking obstacle in my attempts to return to Pennsylvania for my sophomore semester. After the events at the capitol, he is convinced that there’s going to be a civil war breaking out soon (which I strongly feel is logistically impossible, nowhere near enough support among citizens or even Trump’s usual allies.) So yeah, I’ve lost all hope of returning to college this spring. I’m thinking that with two vaccines being distributed across the country for COVID-19, that problem will likely be greatly diminished by August, but I’m wondering if the current political climate will be as tense as it is now. I personally think that there will be far less violence, and that most of the violent Trump supporters will either be arrested or at the very least tolerant of a Biden presidency. What do y’all think?",AskALiberal,1610634715
30,Concerns about some seemingly authoritarian tendencies of the Democratic Party,"First off, I’d like to say that I’m glad that Trump will soon be gone- I believe that the media overblew many of the “little things” he’s done or misconstrued them (I feel like ignoring a liberal bias amongst most major news corporations is pretty naive in 2021), but I recognize that his inflammatory rhetoric and personality make Joe Biden an absolutely better candidate. I’ve just got a few concerns about that... maybe it’s my own anxiety issues or the result of “second-hand skepticism” from growing up in a household that believes that there are Satanic pedophile cults infiltrating the US government, but the recent wins of the Democratic Party concern me. I’ve always considered myself some kind of liberal, though I’ve always been skeptical of politicians (obviously not to the idiotic extent of my QANON-follower parents), especially in regards to three things involving the Democratic Party: gun control, court packing, and statehood for Puerto Rico and DC. I understand that gun control is seen as necessary in the times of Trump militias storming capitals, but a question I’ve asked myself often is, what’s the cutoff? Theoretically, why wouldn’t a sociopathic, power-hungry Democrat try to push legislation to ban guns completely, in order to create an easier to control constituency? Same question for court packing- it seems as though a lot of Democratic supporters (I’m not entirely sure what the general consensus is among actual elected Democrats) are in favor of adding an additional (or multiple) justices to the SCOTUS, in order to even up or override the current 6-3 conservative court, while I fear a government that has control of both houses, the presidency, AND the Supreme Court. I may not like GOP policies or conservative ideals, but the balance of power between the parties in the government always put me at ease whenever I got concerned with a possible authoritarian-leaning future. But, with the recent slew of gun control legislation being introduced after the capitol raid, the possibility of court-packing, and a potential case of electorate stacking in DC and Puerto Rico (I get it, those people deserve to be represented- still, DC is an essentially unshakable blue stronghold, ensuring +2 Dems in the senate, while PR sorta seems like a winnable swing-state) these things only add to the concerns I have about one party having such power in the US.

35,What is the best Pennsylvania Democrat to run in 2022 to flip the seat?,"With the retirement of Pat Toomey, it gives Democrats the opportunity to flip the Pennsylvania senate seat. John Fetterman is currently garnering vast amounts of attention by floating a run for 2022. However, Fetterman is known for his progressive/democratic socialist leanings as he did endorse Bernie sanders in the 2016 primary and I am pretty worried that  Fetterman  would struggle in the suburbs that composed much of the democratic coalition in the 2022 election. While trump won’t be on the ballot in the 2022 and thus Republican turnout will not be quite as high, democratic turnout will not be at 2018 levels, ( my best guess is that given enough organizing they maybe able to each the middle of 2016 and 2018 levels), and it was during the  2018 election that Tom wolf with Fetterman got about 53+ percent of the vote. So while Fetterman would be popular  among base democrats, is he a viable candidate to run statewide for a federal office? After all, Pennsylvania is known to elect moderate as Pennsylvania’s democratic senator is a moderate and was previously quite conservative due to his opposition to abortion.  So is Fetterman the best candidate democrats can field in hopes of winning back the rural/ white non college voters, or should Democrats run a more moderate candidate such as Conor Lamb who is a young rising star that can also win both the suburbs and also trump country to a certain extent?",AskALiberal,1610612824

45,Impeachment Validity.,"THIS IS REPOST FROM A DIFFERENT SUB I WAS CURIOUS WHAT A LIBERAL POINT OF VIEW IS.

So It’s been reported that Mitch McConnell believes something to the nature of

“President Donald Trump committed impeachable offenses and believes that Democrats’ move to impeach him will make it easier to purge Trump from the party.”

He’s also said, “If this election were overturned by mere allegations from the losing side, our democracy would enter a death spiral.”

This all ties into the effort the impeach Trump and the whole inciting violence rhetoric. I’m not an expert in law nor am I in the English language so I don’t know what the specific are to what the legal weight of “incitement” has to be for conviction. But what I can tell it usually comes too “Even if his speech didn’t have a massive effect him and his enablers gaslit these people for months by repeating lies about election fraud.” Gaslit is an umbrella term. This impeachment  I think could have dire consequences/precedent. 

Any opposing party with a majority could simply claim that if there supporters did something violent that the Presidents rhetoric gaslit them to and therefore he incited it and therefore he shall be removed. Rhetoric = ? Would Ron Paul’s rhetoric be peace in the Middle East, so if a bunch of crazed Ron Paul supporters bombed the Pentagon then the congress opposing him could impeach him for gaslighting and inciting this violence at a government agency. I believe this would be a REAL death spiral. Of course that previous scenario is unlikely to take place, but don’t you see how if an opposing party had a majority they could just claim the presidents rhetoric caused violence and that they just be removed.

Don't get me wrong, I completely blame Trump and his allies' rhetoric and spreading lies about the election for what happened at the Capitol, but there's also the fact the he said to protest ""peacefully and patriotically"" which can sort of muddy the waters imo. As for the phone call, since he's not speaking publicly, it's easier to look past the dog whistles therefore making a stronger case for removal.

63,At what point would you be troubled by free speech consequences of corporate actions? At what point should legal restrictions apply?,"I've been posting a lot about this, but I hope you will indulge me once more.  Most liberals have shrugged at recent actions by tech companies, and I've seen two lines of justification for this.  First, there is a view that the specific speech involved (advocacy of insurrection) does not deserve protection, therefore there was no problem with these actions.  This seems fine to me, it's a relatively standard debate about the limits of free speech.  The second view is that because these are private companies, they are free to ban people at their own discretion (which is basically true under existing law).  I have not seen anyone articulate a limiting principle to the second argument (an action that Twitter could take which would be troubling or ought to made illegal).  This seems so utterly crazy to me and so out of step with liberal values that I'm still trying to wrap my head around how anyone could believe.

This post is basically targeted at those making the second argument, and I'm wondering if I'm correct in believing that there is no limiting principle for your argument -- that you believe that social media/tech companies should have a limitless right to ban users, censor content, or manipulate their platforms at their own sole discretion (except perhaps conduct that would be otherwise legally prohibited as fraud or discrimination against a protected class).

So, if I may, out of the following list, which actions (if any) would you find troubling?  These would all be legal under existing law, so are any of these sufficiently troubling that we should do something legally?

1. Twitter bans everyone who posts in support of the Black Lives Matter movement.
2. Facebook removes all posts that discuss the ""double Irish"" tax loophole that it has used to avoid paying billions in income taxes.
3. Google removes from its search results all references to a New York Times article critical of the Google leadership.
4. Google modifies the Android operating system to prevent Android phone owners from sending text messages that mention Bernie Sanders using some form of automated filter.
5. For 72 hours before the 2024 election, Facebook suspends all accounts belonging to individuals that it identifies from voter records as registered Democrats and all pages/account belonging to Democratic candidates for office.
6. Facebook displays a get out the vote message on election day 2024 (a [scientific study](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/13/us/politics/social-networks-affect-voter-turnout-study-finds.html) found that get out the vote messages in 2012 generated several hundred thousand additional votes among users who saw them) but only to users in ""red"" counties \[I believe directly targeting Republicans would violate campaign finance laws, but this would be legal\]
7. Verizon cancels the account of all cellphone subscribers who are registered Democrats.

I'm sure that some of you will protest that the companies would *never* do such things.  Perhaps, and some of these are extreme.  But Google did manipulate its algorithm in an attempt to destroy Yelp, and Mark Zuckerberg [once said](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/04/inside-the-mark-zuckerberg-winklevoss-twins-cage-match): ""You can be unethical and still be legal that’s the way I live my life,"" so I'm not exactly willing to count on these companies being virtuous.

So far as it goes, it's probably true that there's no reason for these companies to target, say, Democrats or BLM.  But there is *absolutely* a reason for them to try to control the conversation around the ""double Irish"" or the French services tax or any of a number of other relatively minor political issues that mean billions or tens of billions to their bottom line and where public opinion is vague, inchoate and probably fairly easy to manipulate.

Finally, I expect some of you will bring in monopoly power.  That's relevant, but I want to put out front that I hardly think it's dispositive (which part of the point of #7 given that Verizon is not a monopoly).  For those that consider these monopolies, suppose that each company was split in two.  Would it really solve the problem if only one of those two companies engaged in such conduct?",AskALiberal,1610570441
64,How do we take back symbols of hate?,"Some symbols are thoroughly embedded in history as symbols of hate. The Swastika is the obvious example. For most of history it was a symbol of peace until appropriated by the Nazis. Especially in a western context, it's now always inappropriate to use this symbol, and I have no desire to return it to its original purpose.

Other symbols have recently been commandeered by the alt-right, like the OK hand symbol, or pepe the frog. These are much less embedded in culture as being symbols of hate. Most people probably aren't even aware of the transition.

I've noticed a response from liberals on the internet to avoid using these symbols because of the risk of inadvertently promoting hate. However, I'm concerned that this gives the alt-right the power to control our speech.

I believe we should intentionally reclaim symbols and keep them from becoming soiled.

One possible strategy was demonstrated by how the Proud Boys name became affiliated with gay pride. By flooding the internet with imagery of gay men with 'Proud Boys' headlines, we managed to create a new association. Now this wasn't ""taking back"" any hate symbols, but I wonder if a similar strategy could be used for the OK hand symbol, or the Punisher character -- pairing the symbol with something antithetical to right-wing hatred, explicitly refusing the appropriation.

81,Net Neutrality and Corporations," Hello,

Approximately five years ago Net Neutrality was described as the ""free speech issue of our time"" by the Left. Liberals believed that private companies would be infringing upon free speech by regulating internet speeds to different customers, that slowing down speeds for certain customers, even while not cutting them off completely, would prevent them from expressing their political views, among other things:

""Several US senators [spoke out](https://www.facebook.com/NowThisPolitics/videos/1595571697140981/) this week on the importance of net neutrality to innovation and free speech. They are right. The Internet has become our public square, our newspaper, our megaphone.. Most importantly, the Internet has played an increasingly vital role in political expression and organizing. Conservative activists from around the country coalesced over various social networking platforms to form the Tea Party movement. The Black Lives Matter movement used Twitter to help spark a national conversation on racial inequality. The Standing Rock Sioux used Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube to galvanize national support for their protests against the Dakota Access Pipeline and its threat to their drinking water. Earlier this year organizers used Facebook and Twitter to share information, plan events, and motivate participation in the Women’s March. What does this have to do with net neutrality? Simple: all of these services depend the existence of open communications protocols that let us innovate without having to ask permission from any company or government.""

&amp;#x200B;

The Left is now broadly supporting the ability for corporations to block and/or limit the speech of customers.

Meanwhile in the House, Kevin McCarthy has told Republicans to ""vote their consciences,"" rather than whip votes in opposition to to impeachnent.

This combined with calls to resign from legislators like Pat Toomey, former Trump allies like Chris Christie and John Kelly, and cabinet officials considering invoking the 25th amendment, is it possible that there might be enough votes in the Senate for Republicans to ditch Trump?

Republicans are engaged in vote suppression, no doubt. But this works because it's an easy sell to less informed voters.

I don’t know a lot of conservatives in real life except those in my family, but they’re single issue voters so I dont think it counts.

What I’ve been reading in these spaces scare me. A lot of the commenters actually think the Dems are the ones pulling a coup. They actually believe that the DNC will send “violent thugs” to their homes if they dare speak out against the party. They believe that the deplatforming of Trump on multiple media is to “stamp out” all of conservatism, and their sub is next. That Trump was sent to us from god to make things right, but we’re violently rejecting him and gaslighting ourselves. That all wrong actions on the part of the right (storming of the capitol, harassing Joe Biden’s campaign bus in texas, attempted kidnapping of the michigan governor) are actually leftists in disguise. That the Dems will keep rigging elections, so they have to arm themselves and fight them. These are all just the highlights. There’s hardly any nuanced discussion, just fear-ridden emotional commentary.

I really want to believe that these comments are from very sick and isolated people. That most conservative Americans are silently waiting for all this to blow over, and we’re only seeing the crazy ones.

12,What do you think of the New Jersey model for free speech?,"This is another free speech post.  I know there have a been a lot of these lately, but I'm really trying to understand where the rest of you are coming from.

I see a lot of people arguing that social media companies may ban whomever they please because they are private businesses who aren't obligated to offer anyone a platform, and that people don't have any sort of right to access the services of a private business.

 So I wanted to talk about an alternative model -- the approach to free speech taken in the State of New Jersey.  Article I of the New Jersey constitution provides: ""Every person may freely speak, write and publish his sentiments on all subjects, being responsible for the abuse of that right.""

In a series of cases, the New Jersey Supreme Court has held that this right is considerably more expansive than the SCOTUS interpretation of the first amendment, and that it does provide important rights against *private* actors -- that there is a right in New Jersey to free speech on private property, when that property is generally open to the public (under the governing [Schmid](https://law.justia.com/cases/new-jersey/supreme-court/1980/84-n-j-535-0.html) test -- the normal use and level of public access to private property is an essential factor; free speech claims are strongest when private property is normally open to the public for multiple uses).

There are a number of cases in this area, but I want to call particular attention to [New Jersey Coalition Against War in the Middle East v. J.M.B. Realty Corporation](https://law.justia.com/cases/new-jersey/supreme-court/1994/a-124-93-opn.html) which involved a dispute between peace activists (opposing war in the Middle East and specifically the Gulf War) and a group of privately owned shopping malls.

The activists wanted to distribute their materials in the shopping malls, but were barred.  The malls argued that ""distribution of issue-oriented speech conflict\[ed\] with their commercial purpose -- to get as many shoppers as possible on the premises and provide an atmosphere that would encourage buying.""   The New Jersey Supreme Court, however, found that the public's right to free speech outweighed the malls' private property interests.  The case as a whole is worth reading, but basically the court found:

* Shopping malls had become ""centers of commercial and social activity"" therefore making them especially important arenas for speech.
* Free speech has always been allowed in downtown districts on public sidewalks.  Shopping malls had (this was 1994) largely taken over the function of downtown districts.  Because shopping malls are enclosed, access inside the mall on private property is necessary to permit a similar degree of free speech.
* That malls generally permitted ""all inclusive"" access to the public, justifying limitations on their right to exclude unwanted political opinions.
* Overall, balancing the mall's claimed harm (the threat to business) against the right to free speech, the free speech won out.

The holding on that last point is worth quoting:

&gt;If free speech is to mean anything in the future, it must be exercised at these centers.  The constitutional right encompasses more than distributing leaflets and associated speech on sidewalks located in empty downtown business districts....   
&gt;  
&gt;Two of the malls contend that granting the Coalition the constitutional right of free speech deprives them of their property without due process of law, takes their property without just compensation, and infringes on their right of free speech. When private property rights are exercised, as in this case, in a way that drastically curtails the right of freedom of speech in order to avoid a relatively minimal interference with private property, the property rights must yield to the right of freedom of speech.

I take it that most of you disagree with this model, and I thought discussing this alternative might be more productive than endlessly rehashing the same aspects of the current one.  So, where has New Jersey gone wrong? So far as I'm aware, there have been any significant downsides to the New Jersey approach that recognizes free speech rights even on private property, and I find it hard to disagree with the court's finding that free speech rights have to evolve to reflect where speech is actually occurring if that right is to remain relevant.",AskALiberal,1610466873

So, I might be a \*bit\* biased, just to be up front. I'm a linguist by trade. I think human language is literally the most powerful thing on the planet in a very real and tangible way. I look at speech like I look at huge construction equipment. Enormously powerful, built with no ill intent, meant to create, ideal for constructive purposes, but readily capable of considerable destruction if used irresponsibly or with destructive intent.

But then we consider the concept of ""freedom of speech,"" and the primacy it holds among American values. The way I've always understood it is that, basically, it's the freedom to criticize the government without fear of retribution. Because of this, the idea that free speech is the liberty to say \*anything\* short of direct, unambiguous instruction to commit existing crimes without \*any\* form of consequence seems like a slightly more novel and separate concept than the legal conceptualization of the first amendment. It feels like an expansion of the idea of free speech, and it feels integral to the dueling realities that are playing out in our politics.

And it's pretty fucking scary, if I'm being honest. In the past few days I've repeatedly seen people arguing here on Reddit, and some folks in this very sub, that the things Trump and his enablers said at the rally cannot be correlated to the events immediately following it. And because it's the way my brain works when I see somebody saying something like that I immediately assume they're dissembling, because seriously how fucking thick do you have to be? But that's beside the point.

I want to have a discussion about language and speech. How powerful is it? How should we handle deliberately ambiguous and untruthful speech that translates into a coup attempt? Should society's ability to punish destructive and damaging speech be abridged? Put another way, should Twitter be able to ban Trump? Should AWS be able to drop Parler from their services? Many, many people on the right are trying to make out those two particular events as a backwards justification for the attempted coup, or at least expressing concern that ""things like that"" led to it.

So what \*should\* be the response? Not talking about the application of our laws, but rather from a philosophical point of view, how should we respond to speech and ideas like the stolen election narrative? That is to say, what is our society to do to defend against a manufactured, dishonest, entirely fabricated narrative created by a sore loser that was used to turn a bunch of Americans into a violent insurrectionist mob that resulted in multiple deaths and was a hair's breadth away from toppling our government?",AskALiberal,1610394408

46,How can I better argue my beliefs?,"So, a recent comment on a post here got me thinking 



I post on this sub a lot because I am rather passionate about politics. However, I am 19 years old and still very much learning. I have some strong political beliefs but I always feel like I can't hold my own in an argument. I do all kinds of reading and stuff but still feel I can't argue well. I am the only liberal in a very conservative trump loving family. I argue with them a lot because of my strong views but I have found myself falling silent when talking to them. Usually when i do a bit of fact checking on what they say afterwards it turns out to be bs.


For example, this weekend I had an argument about the cost and benefits of fda regulations with my libertarian dad. He said that by preventing drugs from coming to market faster the fda was actively harming people. I argued that the tests prevented bad drugs from coming to market. He said that the only way drugs can get tested is through lobbying the FDA and through snuggling up to fda managers. That means that only large companies have the power to do it which creates an oligopoly which causes the massive cost seen in the drug industry. I pointed out that other countries have that sort of thing and the fda prevents bad drugs from coming to market which is obviously good. He said the free market would get rid of bad drugs and that regulators prevent the free market from existing. I didn't know how to respond, so I gave it a google after he left the room. According to John hopkins less than 1% of the cost of drug development comes from fda testing. When I told my dad this he said that he had worked on the software for medical machined and had to go through reams and reams of documents to get it approved. He said because I don't have experience in the real world (I'm a 19 year old college student) I don't know what it's like. Whenever it seems that statistics and facts from reliable sources contradict him, I always end up hearing that and idk how to respond. I also feel the need to fact check stuff like the cost of regulation. He made it sound a lot higher than it actually was.


Anyways, how can I avoid falling into this trap? Avoid running out of counters or not being able to counter what he says because I don't know the specific costs associated with like fda regulation or whatever? He gives similar arguments fror health care and banking regulations. 

I need help arguing because I constantly doubt myself because I hear a lot of conservative talking points all the time and constantly second guess myself. Any help or techniques would be appreciated .

49,How do we ensure Eugene Goodman gets a presidential medal of freedom?,"This man showed an incredible amount of courage and cleverness in the face of what could’ve easily amounted to the death of our republic here in the United States. Rather than letting rioters and insurrectionists run through him he managed to convince the lead part of the pack to divert away from the senate, quite possibly saving the lives of dozens of senators.

[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6uSYhyFa4&amp;bpctr=1610374828) around the 37:00 mark shows officer Eugene Goodman standing at the front of a crowd who minutes earlier had erected a gallows and began chanting “Hang Mike Pence”. 

Rather than running away and saving his own skin he managed to use quick thinking and ingenuity to turn the possibly murderous crowd another direction. I want to make it clear, Eugene Goodman risked his life to save this country. My personal belief is that he deserves every honor we can bestow upon him and most especially a presidential medal of freedom

I know we can’t get Trump to give it to him because he’s the one who sparked off the insurrection but I would like it to remain on the public consciousness after Biden is inaugurated. Biden needs to reward this man so Americans can know what a hero looks like. We cannot let the taint Trump has tried to leave stop us from rewarding honorable acts and we cannot let the rewarding of medals to war criminals diminish what these medals mean and should mean

54,The future of free speech,"So, free speech means the ability to say what you want and the government cannot throw you in jail. That's why trump's claims about his free speech being violated are frankly ridiculous. However, I do think we should talk about the future of what is allowed on social media. Should platforms be allowed to remove anything? I mean it's pretty well known that a lot of lgbtq+ videos about sexual health are demonitized by youtube. I am a big history nerd and watch a lot of history youtubers. One of their biggest complaints is that their educational videos often get demonitized. Those videos aren't hateful or anything, like sexual health isn't hateful or porn or anything, it's just there to help you learn. Those types of videos don't generally cause harm. On the other hand, there are videos chalk full of covid conspiracies and 5g shit that cause active harm. Or there are holocaust deniers spouting off their bs and convincing people of an evil jewish conspiracy. That is actively harmful. Clearly some form of moderation is needed on these platforms, covid and the capitol hill raid have more than proved that case. And yes, like many others I am quite happy watching trump get banned from everything, but I do think that we need some sort of framework in the future to decide what's allowed in social media. Imagine if in the future zuckerburg decides to censor news critical of facebook, or if russia gave facebook a bunch of money and suddenly all anti russian news disappeared. the danger in consolidating the control of information in a few people's hands is that they can be corrupted or serve their own interests. So what framework should we have that determines if content should be taken down or not?

I was thinking if the content is based on misinformation and is actively harmful (like covid conspiracies or holocaust denial). That would still mean conservatives can have their speech in the platform (you can talk about how much you think trickle down economics or tariffs works) but shit like neo-nazi apologia gets taken down. what do you think?

It feels like a lot of these people are now backsliding.  I don’t know what changed— maybe right news media and pundits finally disseminated the talking points for what happened on the 6th, I don’t know— but the narrative seems to have totally shifted from “what happened on the 6th was a disgusting, impeachable, and shocking event” to “this is the natural outcome of democrats censoring the right, these people were justified because of violence from BLM, and the people at the capitol were fighting against tyranny.”

I just don’t know how to respond to what’s going on anymore.  The narrative has shifted so much in the past 5 days.  Suddenly, “free speech” now refers to “the principle of free speech” and not free speech as outlined in our Constitution.  Democrats and twitter are now “silencing the right” by denying them a platform, instead of this being a case of that platform/company exercising *it’s own* freedom of speech.

\*  State and local tax deduction cap. As a CA resident, I see that the  SALT deduction is mainly taken by the rich, the upper middle-class, and  homeowners. Working class Americans take the standard deduction and and  aren't hurt by this change. Capping SALT deductions should raise taxes  on the rich without affecting the working class.

\*  Mortgage/home equity interest deduction reduction. Again, this mainly  helps homeowners, benefiting mostly people who own $1M+ houses.

As  a above-average middle-class CA resident, my ""tax cuts"" were offset by  the cap on SALT deductions, so I ended up switching to the standard  deduction.

81,How should Trump have managed trade disputes with China?,"Hello,

  
So one thing that seems to unite democrats and republicans is a desire to get tough on china. In fact, it seemed to be the one thing dems backed trump on. But obviously, the way he went about it was ineffective. The most we ever got was like part 1 to a trade deal and that was iffy from the start and on weak foundations if I remember correctly, most didn't expect to go far. The trade war screwed over a lot of US farmers and China just sold more to other markets like Brazil. So, what would've been a better approach? 

Here's my idea, and I want to see what y'all think. Is it the right approach?

So a big one is currency devaluation and intellectual property theft. These are important points. The way you solve this is by bringing your case to the WTO. They would probably rule in your favor. China has a history of complying with adverse WTO rulings because it values the international system the WTO underpins. But even if they didn't the WTO would likely authorize tariffs. These tariffs would be seen as legitimate, meaning it would be easier to get allies who have similar complaints (the EU has also brought cases like this to the WTO), to implement tariffs. International pressure on multiple fronts is a far more effective strategy than unilateral tariffs cause China just can't sell more in Europe or Brazil or whatever. Plus, it promotes the diversification of the market as other countries look more viable. Vietnam is looking increasingly better for manufacturing as China becomes more expensive (Samsung already manufactures a lot there). So, if we were to work with the WTO and our allies to implement tariffs we would be seen as the party in the right, and it would be easier to get other countries to follow along. It's a lot easier to say to your people ""We are siding with the Americans in this because China violated international rules that we both agreed too"" than to say ""America strong-armed us into putting on tariffs even though it violates international rules"" or unilateral tariffs. The WTO would be a far more effective institution because of the legitimacy it brings, the minimized blowback (you could potentially have the same effect with no trade war if the WTO ruled in your favor, and if not you would look more legitimate and could better launch a multi-front pressure campaign).

* Trump being silenced by Facebook and Twitter
* Parlor being removed from Google and probably apple.

Now as far as individual cases go, I support both these actions. They are both threats to the general public, no better than yelling fire in a crowded theater, and a lot worse than that.

One thing I think people on the right are correct about is tech companies having the ability to censor people too easily.

32,Arguing with right-wingers about BLM protests vs Capitol hill raid. Is my argument sound? Any flaws you can see? Anything I can add?,"Hello,

Most of my family and my family friends are more right wing and whenever I bring up the capitol hill raid they always mention violence at BLM protests. I usually give the following argument, and I wanted to make sure it's a solid argument.

&amp;#x200B;

So basically the argument right wingers give is: You can't criticize the capitol hill raid without being a hypocrite because you supported BLM despite the violence at protests.

So, here's my response. You're comparing apples and oranges my friend. So first off, the vast vast vast majority of BLM protests across the country did not experience violence. Only like 3.7% (source: [https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/10/16/this-summers-black-lives-matter-protesters-were-overwhelming-peaceful-our-research-finds/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/10/16/this-summers-black-lives-matter-protesters-were-overwhelming-peaceful-our-research-finds/)) even saw property damage or vandalism. The Vast majority were peaceful. In fact, protests tended to turn violent once the cops cracked down hard. I watched australian media get attacked by cops for literally filming. I saw that with my own two eyes. Those reporters weren't violent, they were literally talking. That's far from the only case. Violence usually followed a police crackdown. But even then, 97% were peaceful. And frankly in such a large movement, you can't control everyone. Usually protestors and looters were different people, looters tended to be opportunists who took advantage of the distracted cops. So yeah, BLM isn't responsible for that, and BLM didn't promote violence as an institution. However, the capitol hill raid absolutely did. People showed up armed and with ziptie handcuffs. They broke through the barricade (and not 3%, a huge number of people). But even if they hadn't showed up armed or with ziptie handcuffs, it's still problematic. The purpose of BLM is to bring about police reform. The purpose of the capitol hill raid? To overturn an election that was fair and honest. Those are two different things. So basically, the purpose and methods were completely different. That's not even to mention the very different police responses (just imagine if the capitol hill raiders weren't white, imagine how the cops would've reacted). 

So yeah, that's my general argument. What do you think?",AskALiberal,1610222712
33,Is there any inherent difference between the insurrection at the Capitol and a zombie attack?,"Similarities include a large unarmed force primarily using their advantage in numbers to overwhelm the building occupants, the lack of critical thinking capacity in the brains of the attackers, objective to kill the building occupants, and the high probability of transmitting a fatal infection to the building occupants who survive the attack.",AskALiberal,1610220955
34,What are your thoughts on the alleged coup attempt by Nancy Pelosi following the Capitol riots?,"If you aren’t already aware, reports are coming out of an attempted military coup by Nancy Pelosi shortly after the Capitol riots. [This article](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/08/us/politics/trump-pelosi-nuclear-military.html) from the NYT details the exchange between Pelosi and pentagon officials in which she asks them to limit Trump’s power during the final weeks of his term. Pentagon officials outright denied her request as unconstitutional, and said following through with such orders would constitute a military coup. 

What are your thoughts on this? I see many mainstream commentators alleging the Capitol protests were an attempted coup, would you consider this to be a coup as well? Why or why not?

35,Are you at all worried about going to far when it comes to restricting/banning speech on social media?,"I was just thinking this the other day while hearing about Twitter's notion of banning users who evoke calls to violence, glorify violence, etc:

I'm a heavy metal fan. When I was younger, I had older siblings into the band Manowar, and it rubbed off on me. Manowar's music is power metal, and the lyrics often involve stories about killing and conquering and drinking the blood of your enemies and laughing while they die and pissing on their graves. It's fun. It's self-esteem music. And the spirit reflected in lyrics like that doesn't have anything to do with literally wanting to kill people, as it does with some deeper sense of finding your value and worth, and will to keep fighting forward against whatever enemy you are facing.

...and maybe that's obvious to many, but think about how easily that understanding and context can be lost. 

Suppose I were to quote some Manowar lyrics on Twitter, in the spirit of what I just explained. It would be *so easy* to construe that as a 'glorification of violence', and pretty easy to claim it was a call to violence. I mean, I was gonna try and find some lyrics to post as an example, but it quickly occurred to me that *almost every song* contained lyrics that could be construed in this manner!

I worry about that. I feel like in our fear, we may be abandoning context, and understanding we used to have in favor of lack of understanding. The classic film 12 Angry Men contains a major plot point about how ""I'll kill him!"" is something people say frequently without really meaning they're going to kill someone. It's so very easy to vilify that if you want to, and it takes explanation to show why it's not meant literally. Once we start assuming it's always literal, and requiring explanations of things once considered obvious, that we're now skeptical about...that could lead someplace very bad indeed.

I mean, think of how absurd it now seems that conservatives (and Al Gore's wife) once wanted to fight against violent music, especially rap music, saying listening to music was making people kill each other. Gangsta rap, after all, has a LOT of lyrics about shooting and killing and committing violent acts. They're clearly glorifying that stuff, right? Clearly that's dangerous, and needs to be censored, yes?

If you think that sounds like a bunch of old fogies panicking over music that now seems almost quaint, then try to see the potential connections here. No one wants actual killing, but are we sure restricting speech in this way can't go really bad?

38,How do we fix Social Media?,"To me, it is becoming increasingly clear that social media is playing a central role in radicalizing people. And I don't just mean giving platforms to extreme beliefs: I'm talking about algorithms here.

As it is, social media gives people recommendations of content to follow and consume, just like Amazon would recommend you woodworking tools based on looking at a saw.  These recommendations are curated based on what content you consume.  What often happens through these algorithms is basically the same as indoctrination into a cult.  Nobody starts out with the extreme stuff immediately: it starts by engaging in a mainstream media source with a slight lean.  Then it recommends you other publications further to that direction, and individuals who are fairly mainstream leaders in that direction. A reading of a Fox News article, for example, could trigger you being suggested to follow Tucker Carlson or Ted Cruz or someone like that.  Once you surround yourself with that content, your algorithms will inevitably start suggesting slightly more radical content. Next you're following Trump himself.  From there, you're getting recommended all the White Supremacists he regularly shares or the loopy nutcases like Lin Wood or Sidney Powell who work with him.  Suddenly, you start getting QAnon stuff and you're readily believing that the election is rigged and we need to storm the Capitol to stop the Democrats from instituting Communism. 

It can happen to the Left, too. Consumption of Bernie Sanders media could slowly walk you towards a bunch of Tankie shit.  And that also has the potential to be dangerous. 

What do we do about this? These algorithms seem to be doing a huge amount of the legwork for radicalizing people across America and creating a major divide amongst us.  I don't exactly expect Twitter and Facebook to stop recommending content, so how do we game these filters to counteract the radicalization?",AskALiberal,1610217184

Historical precedence is not in our favor as a newly sworn president is likely to lose the house coming in. So essentially we would have to defy history and try to hold or further cement a majority. And the 2020 house race was a major disappointment despite holding the majority.

But looking at some possible advantage, Stacey Abrams and Georgian Democrats did the impossible and won both senate seats and presidency gaining a surprise Senate majority in the state.

It seems the 75 million Americans who signed on to Trumpism in November is going to be far too many people for widespread acceptance to occur.

For every election I've voted in since I turned 18, I've voted red (because I was raised that way). I also voted for Trump in the most recent 2020 election. Now before all of you tell me how badly Trump lost and how awful of a person I am, let me explain. Yes, I did vote for him.

Did I want to be forever associated with a political party who literally tried to overthrow the seat of American democracy? Did I want to support a president that had no filter and had the ego the size of a mountain? I answered, ""No."" to both of those questions. I then decided that I'd be no longer be voting red in the next elections. So here lies the problem... I don't know how to explain to my parents and family that I am no longer a Republican and that my views have been changed. The last time I tried to tell my dad that, he nearly lost it. I just want my parents, family, and friends to respect my new political views and not to look at me like I'm the Devil's child. How should I go about this?",AskALiberal,1610167342

&gt;After close review of recent Tweets from the @realDonaldTrump
 account and the context around them we have permanently suspended the account due to the risk of further incitement of violence.

&gt;In the context of horrific events this week, we made it clear on Wednesday that additional violations of the Twitter Rules would potentially result in this very course of action.

&gt;Our public interest framework exists to enable the public to hear from elected officials and world leaders directly. It is built on a principle that the people have a right to hold power to account in the open.

https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/suspension.html

&gt;The below is a comprehensive analysis of our policy enforcement approach in this case.

&gt;Overview

&gt;On January 8, 2021, President Donald J. Trump tweeted:

&gt;“The 75,000,000 great American Patriots who voted for me, AMERICA FIRST, and MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, will have a GIANT VOICE long into the future. They will not be disrespected or treated unfairly in any way, shape or form!!!”

&gt;Shortly thereafter, the President tweeted:

&gt;“To all of those who have asked, I will not be going to the Inauguration on January 20th.”

&gt;Due to the ongoing tensions in the United States, and an uptick in the global conversation in regards to the people who violently stormed the Capitol on January 6, 2021, these two Tweets must be read in the context of broader events in the country and the ways in which the President’s statements can be mobilized by different audiences, including to incite violence, as well as in the context of the pattern of behavior from this account in recent weeks. After assessing the language in these Tweets against our Glorification of Violence policy, we have determined that these Tweets are in violation of the Glorification of Violence Policy and the user @realDonaldTrump should be immediately permanently suspended from the service.

&gt;Assessment

&gt;We assessed the two Tweets referenced above under our Glorification of Violence policy, which aims to prevent the glorification of violence that could inspire others to replicate violent acts and determined that they were highly likely to encourage and inspire people to replicate the criminal acts that took place at the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021.

&gt;This determination is based on a number of factors, including:

&gt;President Trump’s statement that he will not be attending the Inauguration is being received by a number of his supporters as further confirmation that the election was not legitimate and is seen as him disavowing his previous claim made via two Tweets (1, 2) by his Deputy Chief of Staff, Dan Scavino, that there would be an “orderly transition” on January 20th.

&gt;The second Tweet may also serve as encouragement to those potentially considering violent acts that the Inauguration would be a “safe” target, as he will not be attending. 

&gt;The use of the words “American Patriots” to describe some of his supporters is also being interpreted as support for those committing violent acts at the US Capitol.

&gt;The mention of his supporters having a “GIANT VOICE long into the future” and that “They will not be disrespected or treated unfairly in any way, shape or form!!!” is being interpreted as further indication that President Trump does not plan to facilitate an “orderly transition” and instead that he plans to continue to support, empower, and shield those who believe he won the election. 

&gt;Plans for future armed protests have already begun proliferating on and off-Twitter, including a proposed secondary attack on the US Capitol and state capitol buildings on January 17, 2021. 

&gt;As such, our determination is that the two Tweets above are likely to inspire others to replicate the violent acts that took place on January 6, 2021, and that there are multiple indicators that they are being received and understood as encouragement to do so.",AskALiberal,1610149509

* Voting options were expanded by the courts without approval from the legislature, which has ultimate authority over how the state's electoral votes are allocated.

Is this actually true, or do they just disagree with the court's interpretation of some Pennsylvania law? What typically happens if an election really is found to have been run inappropriately?

* Courts have struck down the all the election fraud lawsuits based on a lack of standing, they didn't actually get to the point of considering the evidence.

While I'm not saying that a lack of standing shouldn't be used to throw out a case, it certainly changes the conclusions one can draw from the fact the case was thrown out. Are there cases that were clearly decided based on the (lack of) evidence?

Should it be a crime to publish materials leaked by a government whistleblower when those documents reveal unlawful, unethical actions?

There seems to be a lot of confusion where people assume that Assange is being charged for releasing materials in 2016 when in reality nothing within the charges has anything to do with that because the Mueller Report concluded that there was insufficient evidence to charge Assange or Wikileaks for publishing those documents.

1,How much does a death change your stance on a riot vs the destruction of millions of dollars of property?,"A lot of the focus on the race riots this summer was on the millions of dollars of property destroyed. Conservatives are quick to point this out first, the destruction of property, possibly peddling the belief that this ""ruins"" a life in the same way a death would.

However, you can say one thing about BLM rioters: they didnt kill anyone.

In fact, the only deaths I am aware of that can be attributed directly to BLM riots were the people killed by Kyle Rittenhouse in Kenosha, and he was of course there to OPPOSE BLM, not affiliate with them.

We can differentiate between the causes of death here and who is responsible:
- When a rioter breaks the law and possibly jeopardizes the lives of others, and they get shot and killed, that death is justified as self-defense, and the rioters themselves share the blame for forcing those whose lives they jeopardized to fire their guns in self defense (which is why the woman killed at the capitol and her fellow rioters are at fault). 
- When a protester is just walking down the street and not actually threatening anyone and gets shot and killed, that is NOT justified (which is why Kyle Rittenhouse deserves blame for his murders, not BLM). 
- When a policeman is doing his correct duty to stop a riot and gets killed for doing it, then the riot is at fault for causing the death of someone who didn't even ask for any of this.

All of this is to say that the Capitol Riots are now in a league of their own for having caused the death of someone who didn't even want anything to do with the riot. It may be an aside for this discussion to talk about HOW bad this death is, but I think it matters a lot.

13,When the pandemic subsides and social distancing/masks aren’t as urgent are you going to re evaluate who your true friends are after four years of Trump?,"Let me explain. I live in a pretty conservative area. Most people in my area like Trump. So if I were to turn a blind eye to everyone that’s a Trump supporter I’d likely have no friends. 


For the most part I was able to get along with these people well. As long as we didn’t talk politics we were good. We had other interests besides politics so there was no need. 

After 2020 and seeing some posts these people are saying on Twitter, Facebook etc I’m starting to look at some of these people I considered friends a little differently. Cheering Trump on about how he’s handled the pandemic. Chanting all lives matter and even bashing peaceful protesting like kneeling. Supporting Trump’s attempts at overturning the election results. 

The one kicker that’s really pissed me off recently are some of these reactions to the Capitol Hall riot. Some of these people I considered friends at one point are actually saying it might have been Antifa or BLM. They still stand by what they say in “you democrats riot and loot when you don’t get your way. Not us.” I’m also pulling my hair out when they’re comparing this riot to Black Lives Matter riots. While both were bad, they’re fighting over two different issues. One is a civil rights issue, the other one was a fucking assault on democracy and an attempted coup. How hard is that to understand? 

But yeah, I have no idea when things will start looking more normal. I have no idea when vaccine distribution will speed up. It probably will once Biden gets in. But once it does, I think I’m going to re evaluate who I allow back into my life after these times. This is not arguing pizza topping or sports teams. Some of this shit goes against my morals.",AskALiberal,1610087282

28,Is it moral/ethical for Simon &amp; Schuster to no longer publish Hawley's book?,"I was discussing this issue with a friend, and I completely disagree with him but I'm trying to phrase the argument fairly.

So Simon &amp; Schuster, which is owned by Viacom, was supposed to publish Hawley's book ""The Tyranny of Big Tech,"" which I assume was just a 2024 launching pad but that's a separate issue. After everything that happened in DC yesterday, [the company announced](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/07/books/simon-schuster-josh-hawley-book.html) that they were no longer publishing the book.

My friend's position is essentially threefold: 1) It's bad that mega corporations are deciding what views we're allowed to hear; 2) If a corporation had decided to do something like this to Representative Omar after she supported BLM (or, in my view, got in trouble for her comments on Israel), liberals would be furious and calling for a boycott of Simon &amp; Schuster, and; 3) If Viacom can punish an anti-big tech senator what's to stop them from retaliating if the government ever pushes for serious regulation?

Personally I don't think anyone is entitled to sell a book, nor do I think any company is obligated to associate themselves with a person, but my friend's position is that political books should be published on the merit of the book and not the politics.

He told me:

&gt;Social media has wrecked the entire society. Everyone is thinking on such a low level all the time. Like no doubt every “liberal” will cheer a member of the US senate being censored by a massive conglomerate for his actions as a senator.

When I told him it's possible I'm not a moron and honestly just don't see what the government can do (I don't think it can morally or legally compel a publisher to publish), he said:

&gt; ""I don’t think there’s a non-moronic argument to actively support massive corporations censoring individuals they don’t like after signing deals with them. If it becomes normalized our society would be fully dystopian and it would be impossible to reach enough people to change it.""

&gt;Blake, who is Black, was struck by seven bullets at close range Aug. 23 as he walked away from Kenosha police Officer Rusten Sheskey, who had answered a domestic disturbance call.

Given that this is the case, though, and everything that’s happened leading up to it, what’s it going to take for you to personally move past these events? When I say personally, I mean on an individual level.

I ask because I see a lot of conservatives suddenly pleading for peace and civility in the very recent history. Many exasperated individuals unable to understand why we can’t all just get along *now*. They’re ready *now* to be calm and civil. They lament the division, and want to heal it. Or so they say.

So let’s meet them where they’re at, but not without preconditions in my opinion. Put yourself, as a reasonable and reality-informed individual presumably, across the table from a Trumpist-in-recovery. What do you need to hear from them? What kind of gestures of good faith will make a difference for you?

This is genuine and serious. I know a lot of you don’t want to ever imagine giving a conservative room to breath in political spaces, much less speak openly, after what we’ve witnessed, and I don’t necessarily disagree, but I will say I think some of them have had their shells cracked and some sunlight might be piercing through here. I’m more wont to shatter shells than gently coax out the timid little being inside, so I’m hoping to field this question to the kinds of people that can take a more tactful but candid and realistic approach than I can muster.

I would respond to that argument with these thoughts:

- The overwhelming majority of BLM supporters / allies want PEACEFUL protests. There was a great graphic circulating around the time of all the racial unrest this summer showing how the beliefs of ""I support the cause of racial justice"" and ""I do not support rioting"" can very easily coexist. I personally attended BLM rallies at the very site of George Floyd's death (I am a Minneapolis resident and wasn't working that week) and the leadership of BLM emphasized PEACEFUL, NON-VIOLENT protest. Just because you saw a YouTube video with a handful of people from who-knows-where being violent doesn't mean you've seen an accurate depiction of the movement as a whole. 
- A lot of those who caused violence at these riots were not affiliated with BLM; they showed up just to cause chaos, possibly make BLM look worse, etc. There are numerous cases of this happening in Minneapolis alone.
- The importance of racial justice still matters far more than some burnt-down property. If you want to know why we don't support shutting down the entirety of BLM just to stop the small minority from rioting, that's why. A burnt down business is not as bad as the colossal destruction of an entire race of people in this country. If you really think some burnt down businesses are worse than what happens to blacks in this country on a daily basis, then you are SEVERELY uninformed.
- More to the point, a burnt down business affects the people who own the business while an assaulted US Capitol building affects the entirety of democracy which affects every single citizen in this country. An assault on Democracy is FAR, Far worse.

*Counter-case:*  There might be some of these people, but they are few in number, and they are of little relevance in the debate on drugs.

Rather, what drives most legalization critics is a belief that a fair number  of people who smoke weed try harder drugs and then end up having issues, including hardcore addiction.  Many of these people believe the *gateway theory* -- but not the technical definition that marijuana has some unique psychoactive characteristics that make people say:  *""I want to do heroin now.""*

Rather, they see pot as an introduction to the drug culture.  Curiosity is a notable human attribute.  Tons of people who smoke weed get curious about other drugs, especially psychedelics.  Which is *partly* why we now see this:   [NPR: From Marijuana To Mushrooms, Voters Want Drug Laws Eased](https://www.npr.org/2020/11/04/931507602/from-marijuana-to-mushrooms-voters-want-drug-laws-eased).  Excerpt:

&gt;Oregon, which legalized marijuana for recreational use in 2014, went a step further Tuesday and voted to decriminalize illicit drugs. Measure 110 makes the possession of small quantities of cocaine, heroin, methamphetamines and other drugs a civil violation subject to a $100 fine, but no jail time. 

 And if we legalize psychedelics there is a strong case to legalize ecstasy, and probably 10 - 15 designer drugs that are somewhat close to psychedelics in their  effects. Another poster on the Drugs sub recently posted a  useful [drugs ranking - softest to hardest](https://old.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/kfzsvg/how_would_you_rank_drugs_from_softest_to_hardest/).  Helps inform how many drugs there are now.  A glance at  [Erowid](https://www.erowid.org/psychoactives/psychoactives.shtml) shows the list is much  longer.

Each drug has its aficionados (and of course most hard drug users use multiple drugs, complicating things).   If we have booze, weed, psychedelics, ecstasy, and some designer drugs legal, that puts a burden on society to evaluate the entire list of drugs.   What's that now,  40 to 60 substances for consideration? 

Many people see this growing drug legalization enterprise  as a big minefield.  Things were fairly simple when we had a simple delineation between alcohol and all other drugs, i.e., intoxicants.  Black and white.

*Uphot:*   Everyone, including the DEA's drug warriors,  knows tons of responsible people smoke weed. Opposition to marijuana for the past 20 years has had not been primarily about marijuana.  **If society had only alcohol and marijuana as intoxicants, we would have legalized pot a long time ago.**  The issue is all intoxicants collectively, and marijuana proponents' *unconvincing* claim that smoking  pot has little role in people getting wrapped up in the hard drug culture.

&gt; President-elect Joe Biden plans to nominate Merrick B. Garland, a Democratic casualty of the bitter partisan divide in Washington over court nominees, to become the next attorney general, according to people familiar with the decision. 

&gt; Garland, 68, serves as a judge on the federal appeals court in the District. He is best known for being nominated to the Supreme Court in 2016 by President Barack Obama – but Senate Republicans refused to give him a hearing, and the high court opening was eventually filled the following year by President Trump’s choice, Neil M. Gorsuch.

3,Can Biden lure a Republican Senator into resignation with a cabinet offer? Should he?,"Given the victory yesterday, we've taken control of the Senate.  It's much less attractive for Senators, especially those nearing retirement, to serve in the minority than the majority.  The average Republican Senator won't be able to do much over the next two years.

This might give Biden a significant opportunity to expand the majority to 51-49 if he's able to coax a Republican Senator from a state with a Democratic governor into taking one of the as-yet unassigned Cabinet-level roles (Commerce, Labor, CIA, Small Business Administration) or a plum ambassadorship.  

Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania would be the most plausible target.  He has 2 years left in the Senate, has announced he won't seek re-election, and might be interested in the Department of Commerce.  PA Governor Tom Wolf is a Democrat, and would pick Toomey's successor.  Toomey has also been outspoken in defending the results of the election.

Richard Burr of North Carolina has also announced that he won't seek reelection in 2020 (and Dem Governor Roy Cooper would appoint his replacement).  He's a long-serving member of the Intelligence Committee and might be interested in the CIA job, though he's probably still under a criminal insider trading investigation.

Other possible targets, where a Republican Senator comes from a state with a Democratic governor are:

* Jerry Morgan and Roger Marshall of Kansas (Moran is extremely conservative and up for re-election in 2022; it's Kansas and that won't be a tough fight. Marshall was just elected).
* Mitch McConnell an Rand Paul of Kentucky (both of those would just be completely crazy.
* Bill Cassidy and John Kennedy of Louisiana (again unlikely targets)
* Susan Collins of Maine (just re-elected of course, but maybe she'd be interested in something?)
* Thom Tills of North Carolina (just re-elected)
* Ron Johnson of Wisconsin (up for re-election in 2022, apparently planning to run).

I don't think turning college into Highschool 2 is good for college or helpful to anyone, because if we make four year college free, then all that means is that Bachelors will continue to become devalued as *everyone* will have them, then employers will look at Masters and graduate education which will still cost money. 

That being said, I DO believe in investing in education, but at our public middle and highschools. Improve education quality there (possibly including ideas like: raising teacher pay and teacher standards, reduce class sizes, make sure every school has mental health councelor(s), try to make teacher ethnic make-up match the student body etc), and you will be improving education quality across the board. 

College can be more difficult for students without a good foundation, and therefore some students from poorer neighborhoods with lower quality schools will be left behind. Thus not everyone will benefit from free college (I have seen some articles say it actually benefits mostly middle and upper class students), to contrast I believe investing more in k-12 benefits *all* students from all backgrounds.

There isn’t a lot of topic or articles that truly cover them outside of voting analysis.

I have some general ideas about them. They’re really into gaming quite heavily. I know they tilt conservative. I know they grew up around the time internet culture grew exponentially. They wear shoes inside the house.  And that’s really about it.

So I have some general questions:

What is the type of lifestyle they grew up in? The family environment and expectations?

What does religion mean to young white men growing up, is this something they deeply value or do they follow the trend of growing agnosticism amongst youth?

Something I notice is that they really like making no homo jokes. I’d write them off as just joking around but it is at a point where I feel like there’s something subconsciously happening at this point. Do they fear being thought of as gay?

How do they value the health of themselves and others around them?

Do they think America as it is now has failed them? If so who or what do they blame for it?

Do they interact with their own group for the most part?

What value is it that makes them conservative? Or is it an environmental aspect based on parenting and the people around them?

21,How do you feel about Yuri Bezmenov’s words back in 1984?,"The KGB defect talked in 1984 about how he already felt the 4 stages of moral shifting occurred in 1960-1980, but as his interview popped up on my recommended again, it’s very interesting to see that what he is saying is almost identical to what is being shown today, whether it’s for the better or the worse. 

If you are not aware, Yuri Bezmenov made an interview warning Americans of a potential soviet outcome for their nation. He described the 4 stages of how that would happen as: demoralisation, destabilisation, crisis, normalisation.

The first stage is demoralisation, where Bezmenov stated 
&gt; What it basically means is: to change the perception of reality of every American to such an extent that despite of the abundance of information no one is able to come to sensible conclusions in the interest of defending themselves, their families, their community, and their country.

He later goes on about the state of the people who have been “demoralised”:

&gt; They are programmed to think and react to certain stimuli in a certain pattern [alluding to Pavlov]. You can not change their mind even if you expose them to authentic information. Even if you prove that white is white and black is black, you still can not change the basic perception and the logic of behavior.

&gt; A person who was demoralized is unable to assess true information. The facts tell nothing to him. Even if I shower him with information, with authentic proof, with documents, with pictures; even if I take him by force to the Soviet Union and show him [a] concentration camp, he will refuse to believe it, until he [receives] a kick in his fan-bottom. When a military boot crashes his balls then he will understand. But not before that. That's the [tragedy] of the situation of demoralization.

The second stage is destabilisation:

&gt; During this two-to-five-year period, what matters is the targeting of essential structural elements of a nation: economy, foreign relations, and defense systems. Basically, the subverter (Russia) would look to destabilize every one of those areas in the United States, considerably weakening it.

The third stage would be ""crisis"". It would take only up to six weeks to send a country into crisis, explained Bezmenov. The crisis would bring ""a violent change of power, structure, and economy"" and will be followed by the last stage, ""normalization."" That's when your country is basically taken over, living under a new ideology and reality.

How do you feel about the soviet/far left threat he is warning of? To what extent do you feel his words of ideological subversion/ideological warfare are true and if not, why? Also, what do you feel is the best way to fix this problem if his ideas of what a demoralised person are as bad as they are said to be?",AskALiberal,1609890078

""Senator Kamala Harris started her life’s work young.

At some point, she fell from the stroller (few safety regulations existed for children’s equipment back then), and the adults, caught up in the rapture of protest, just kept on marching. By the time they noticed little Kamala was gone and doubled back, she was understandably upset. “My mother tells the story about how I’m fussing,” Harris says, “and she’s like, ‘Baby, what do you want? What do you need?’ And I just looked at her and I said, ‘Fweedom.’”

**Maine:** Sara Gideon was how far ahead in the polls and she lost by how much? Susan Collins' popularity was that low and she somehow won? Outside the rumors of electoral messiness how does such a thing happen? Are Mainers that stubborn? Are ""Flatlander"" insults that powerful even with York and Cumberland counties keeping that state from being Mississippi with snow?  
**Iowa:** Joni Ernst did everything she did to lose, right down to verbal faux pas after faux pas. Somehow, she won over a Theresa Greenfield who was leading her in the polls.   
**North Carolina:** Why, oh why couldn't Cal Cunningham keep his affair under wraps? The ""We can't campaign by traditional methods because COVID"" reasoning of NC Dems didn't help either. Now they get the stigma of the loathed Tillis as senior senator and in NC-11 a Nazi cripple beating a veteran all while Georgia leapfrogs them into becoming a blue state.

Never mind that the second those peaches reach that temperature the first and last thing they’re used for is overwhelming, virulent, disgusting and violent racism. That’s for a different thread.

How much of what’s happening on Parler is representative of the right? It seems like an easier question than it is: consider that it’s being amplified by places like r/ParlerWatch. I don’t have the temerity to actually make an account there and see what’s really going on, but I’m wary of falling into the same traps that places like KiA and TiA created for their user bases by cherry picking the most egregious examples of whatever regrettable behavior and broadcasting that as common.

However, the impression that I’ve gotten of Parler is that it’s basically Fox News commenters, the worst parts of Facebook and conspiracy YouTube channels, and the grifters that grift from those people. And the content there is... deeply disturbing.

But is it just signal boosting the worst of the conservatives? Or is it giving voice to what a large chunk of them seem to believe?

I think this leads to a lot of the disconnect. And I think to many people often don’t separate morality and legality even though they are different concepts. For example, most people probably believe it’s morally or ethically wrong to cheat on one’s spouse but I don’t think many people would argue that we should criminalize adultery.

However, there doesn't appear to be any common ideas when we're super polarized.

On one side of the aisle, there's an elderly man from rural Iowa who's current outfit of choice is the ""MAGA hat + disposable mask with a hole cut into it combo"" who wants America law to be based around Christianity, for there to be no social safety net, and for the country to have hardly any legal immigration.

On the other, we have a young 30 year old from Boston who's a self described Social Democrat. They have [this sign](https://www.amazon.com/DesignThatSign-Believe-Equality-Rights-Matter/dp/B089Y9Q6RP) in front of their house and believe the United States should adopt what they describe as ""Internationally proven policy"" like Universal Healthcare, a robust social safety net, etc.

These two people couldn't be any more different. The former spends $150 a month on cable (to watch one channel, Fox News), while the latter is a Cord Cutter. The former attends church on Sundays and Wednesdays, the latter doesn't go at all. The former is a ""Meat and Potatoes Man"", the latter loves to ""splurge"" on ""health conscious and environmentally friendly"" restaurants.

They have no common ideas. They hate each other. And they're not extreme outliers, but rather there's a whole bunch of people like both of them.

It doesn't help that America's soft power dominance has transformed anything that could be uniquely American into non-unique, global things. *The Simpsons, McDonalds, Blue Jeans, Apple Pie*? Global, not American. *Letterkenny, Tim Hortons, Toques, Nanaimo Bars*? Distinctly Canadian. As such, ""America has no culture"" while ""Canada (or whatever country you choose to try this with) has such a unique and exotic culture"". Even though it's impossible for a place to have no culture. To be American is the closest thing to having no nationality. [It's currently the only superpower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superpower) and therefore to be American is to be the boring, bland, uncool default. Why be American when you can be ""[Christian first, American second](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/christian-first-american-second/)""?

92,What should we do about credit card companies?,"Credit cards are a benefit for the privileged who have the dependable income and financial skills to maintain a small debt and build up credit and rewards, cashback, etc.

However, credit card companies make most of their money from interest. As I understand it, this revenue comes from people who either don't have the financial skills to spend what they can pay every month, or from people who don't have the money they need from month to month, and go further and further into debt.

* Should credit cards be made illegal, or have some kind of regulation to protect poor people from predation?
* Should there be some kind of law or government action to prevent credit scores from becoming so widely necessary to function in society? As it stands I'm essentially required to own a credit card

If not, what percent capacity should they be running at? 10%? 25%? Should the congregation be able to sing with masks? What about vocal soloists instead of an entire church choir? Some churches are notorious for talking with each other for half an hour after services are over, should local ordinances target that too?

One other thing to think about too is religious ceremonies specific to certain sects. Mass and the participation of the sacraments such as communion in Catholicism present more COVID infection opportunities than say a Baptist preacher doing his thing at the pulpit with a mask on.

I know that the church of Jesus Christ is still serving the sacrament to it's members in a modified form to prevent the spread of COVID-19 when local ordinances allow for them to meet.",AskALiberal,1609693233

95,How do you feel about red states getting disproportionate federal aide?,"As most of you know, red states pay way less in taxes than they get back in federal aide. These states tend to be the least educated, sickest, and poorest.

On the one hand, as a progressive, I believe it is the government's duty to help these people.

On the other hand, it's these people that vote in politicians like Mitch McConnell that ruin this country for the rest of us. They rail against socialism and preach smaller government, states rights and sovereignty, etc. But they don't realize that they are the ones getting handouts from blue states. They oppose things like universal healthcare, which would not only benefit the entire country but significantly benefit people in poor, red states.

I know practically and morally this shouldn't be done, but sometimes I wish we would just stop giving this much aide to these red states, to show them that government is sometimes necessary to alleviate social ills. This would also allow richer blue states to set up their own healthcare systems, without the burden of having to subsidize smaller states.",AskALiberal,1609691619
96,Are the majority of Republican voters now getting the majority of their news from Fox?,"Thanks for all the replies to my recent question about CNN/MSNBC vs Fox and who's more relentless in their political agendas.  Here's a followup...

Someone I know who works in a hospital was talking with a 60-something lady (patient, non-Covid) who was talking about her appreciation for Trump, and how terrible Joe Biden is, and she was able to list 1 or 2 outrageous money scandals related to him.  

Where would she have gotten that information?  Local newspapers don't get into that detailed level of obscure national political scandal stories.   The evening TV news (ABC/NBC/CBS channels) don't usually go there.  She probably doesn't read right wing websites like Drudge, and she probably doesn't read conservative things like WSJ or National Review.  So where did she get that?

Fox News?

And are the majority of Republican voters now getting the majority of their news from Fox?  Does the TV just stay on that channel for many hours a day?

And when you hear Republicans talk buzzwords like ""Socialism"" and ""Liberal Agenda"" are they getting it mostly from Fox?  It sure doesn't seem to be coming from any other common media sources that's generally available to them.",AskALiberal,1609687110
97,Where does civic nationalism go in a world where America is the international default with high domestic polarization?,"It's generally accepted that America is a country built on Civic Nationalism. That is, people are American because they're born here, share a unique set of national characteristics, etc. Putting it all together, this requires a sense that America is unique and that American is a legitimate identity.

However, ""American"" is the global default. Before 1991, not being the Soviets was what glued us together. But as the U.S is the sole superpower since 1991, that's gone. The rest of the world compares itself to the United States (and many more Left Wing countries have a pride in being not-American, as we're the conservative outlier nobody wants to live in when it comes to things like Religion, Healthcare, Time off Work, Gun Laws, and Incarceration). It's almost as if by being American, you're born stateless. Rather than it being a part of your identity like if you were Canadian. it's just a legal title you have no personal connection with. You're not unique or the ""other"" (like every other country sees themselves in relation to the global community with America as the sole superpower), so it's hard to notice that you have a nationality. You're the default and you don't have to think about the concept of nationality if you don't choose to. As anything that could be originally construed as ""American Culture"" quickly lost that distinction as soft power diffused it across the globe. McDonalds, Jeans, The Simpsons? Hardly American, but global. The Canadian equivalents? Distinctly Canadian. Because of this, people will say that Canada has a culture. While America ""has no culture"". Even though that's a lie, as it's impossible for a place to not have a culture. It also doesn't help that the country is more isolated and self contained than others. With low consumption of non-American culture, low propensity to travel abroad, and no diaspora. Americans are the only nationality who don't have to think about being a nationality. 

Americans also either turn away from the identity due to factors like religion or embarrassment. The right wing ([or at least 40% of Americans](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2007/02/23/christians-first-americans-second/)) will say that they're ""Christian First, American Second"" ([Ted Cruz being a famous example](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/christian-first-american-second/)), while certain left wingers lament at the fact that they're American and would rather move to somewhere like Canada if interpersonal ties or immigration policy didn't get in the way. As America is seen as an embodiment of Evangelical Social Conservatism, Extreme Libertarian Fiscal Policy, and a highly interventionalist foreign policy. Not only is America seen as the ""bland boring default"" (since soft power prevented anything that could be uniquely American from becoming uniquely American) but also the country of the people who are on the other side of the political/cultural aisle. Polarization has gotten that bad.

How can civic nationalism survive if there's nothing unique about the United States, other than it being the sole force (whether by geography or lack of ability to emigrate) making you have to deal with people on the other side of a very polarized aisle?",AskALiberal,1609686983

* ""*diversity initiatives also seem to do little to convince minorities that companies will treat them more fairly*""
* ""*Groups that typically occupy positions of power may feel alienated and vulnerable.*""
* ""*Diversity initiatives’ strongest accomplishment may actually be protecting the organization from litigation — not protecting the interests of underrepresented groups.*""
*  *A longitudinal* *study* *of over 700 U.S. companies found that implementing diversity training programs has little positive effect and may even decrease representation of black women.* 

Another thing that I'm wondering about is how they should approach the idea of intersectionality. The stereotypical diversity training program in the U.S only touches upon the axises of Race and Gender (With such trainings stereotyped as lumping a white woman and a Black man into the ""Minority cohort"" and lazily framing their experiences as identical) , whereas intersectionality (which didn't have much awareness when diversity training first became mainstream) is a highly nuanced approach that focuses on a way wider variety of axises and makes way further distinctions.

I'm not sure how much of the stereotypes about them are Right Wing lies (The stereotype definitely feels like a Right Wing caricature, and the stereotype appears to sweep things like Homophobia, Ableism, and Transphobia under the rug, which from my experience the people who are likely to set up such trainings are fully aware of). 

If the stereotype is true however, it definitely seems to be the corporate equivalent of ""I'm not racist, I have a Black friend"" and could do more harm than good. With the line in the Harvard article (""Diversity initiatives’ strongest accomplishment may actually be protecting the organization from litigation — not protecting the interests of underrepresented groups""*)* possibly serving as an indication of this.

32,Question regarding medical &amp; banking regulation,"Hello,

My father is a hard-core liberatarian who is opposed to most kinds of regulation. He is very very frustrated with the regulation of finance and medicine in particular because he feels that they are the reasons behind the high costs and market failures. However, when I read from actual experts in the field, I hear the opposite: lack of regulation is behind the high costs and failures. So in particular, he feels that banking regulation prevents new banks from forming and this prevents competition in the market, combine this with regulatory capture and you get ""too big too fail"". According to him, this style of regulation combined with the Fed raising interest rates caused 2008. He also believes that the US effectively subsidizes healthcare world wide. Here's what he means: most other developed nations have universal health care, which means that they pay lower costs than they would in a purely free market system. According to him, firms need to offset their costs somewhere, so they do so in the American market. He believes all the data about universal health care abroad is misleading and inaccurate largely for this reason and that if the US adopted some universal health care costs would shoot up worldwide to compensate.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I tend to disagree with him. I'll write out my response below, but if you were in my shoes, what would you say to him?

Financial markets: More regulation and oversight is absolutely needed here. These markets have become extremely consolidated because banks will routinely capture regulators and ensure that things like anti-trust aren't enforced properly. The repeal of dodd-frank is one such example, but there are plenty of others. See Mrs. Gramm as chairman of the CTFC only to then join Enron and leave behind a regulator who literally never ruled in favor of the complaint. So yeah, regulatory capture is an issue. 2008 however, was caused by a lack of regulation not too much. Basically, 2008 was caused by a deregulation that allowed for hedge funds to engage in trading with derivatives (in particular profitable mortgages). Naturally, this increased the demand for mortgages and the demand rose so high, so banks decided to meet that demand and issue more mortgages. Because demand was so high (because these were basically risk-free thanks to CDOs and because mortgages were seen as safe bets and were bundled together so it was unlikely to fail entirely), banks issued mortgages to more and more people until eventually they started issuing to people who really shouldn't have had a mortgage, i.e. subprime borrowers. This was only further worsened by lowered interest rates which made these mortgages even more attractive to borrowers. Effectively, you had an asset bubble, more and more people bought mortgages and more and more people who shouldn't have gotten them, got them.  So, these mortgage backed securities became increasingly toxic and soon investors would lose confidence. This was worsened by the fact that many of these CDOs also had credit default swaps baked into them wherein banks who knew what was going on sold these instruments to investors whilst simultaneously betting against them with CDSs. Frankly, a deal like that shouldn't be allowed ([https://www.propublica.org/article/misdirection-in-goldman-sachss-housing-short](https://www.propublica.org/article/misdirection-in-goldman-sachss-housing-short)).

&amp;#x200B;

Medical markets: There is arguably some truth to the subsidizing thing, but idk if it is true or not so i'll refrain from comment. However, that's not the reason for high drug prices.

[https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2016/11/30/12945756/prescription-drug-prices-explained](https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2016/11/30/12945756/prescription-drug-prices-explained)

Basically, drugs cost a lot because the american health care system is divide and we don't pay in bulk. As such, all our insurance agencies have less bargaining power and the one agency that does have good bargaining power is Medicare but it is prevented from doing so by federal law. So, i guess, in a way, a regulation preventing medicare from negotiating is causing high drug prices, but that's not the kind of regulation he is frustrated with.

45,Why did America swing so far to the right in the 80’s?,"Most people seem to be in agreement that the 80’s is when America started it’s rightward lurch. Richard Nixon dismissed Barry Goldwater and William Buckley as “far right nuts.” Americans were still relatively moderate-conservative in the social side but we liked the new deal, social security, the minimum wage, unions. Today, only 11% of workers are in a union. Now, would you say the public turning against unions is what made Americans more conservative as a whole? I wasn’t around, but I believe they were blamed partly for the 1970’s recession. Another person everyone blames for that is Carter. In people’s minds, was Reagan such a successful president that he single handedly change people’s minds about “big government”? I mean, what they don’t tell you is that Carter actually did more deregulation than Reagan did, Reagan never shrunk the deficit, and Reagan wasn’t THAT popular when he was in office. His approval rating got as low as 35% and it averaged at 52. Yet, his policies kind of stuck. Clinton continued the theme with “the age of big government is over!” We’ve had recessions since them, and they’ve turned a lot of my generation against conservatism or capitalism in general, but was the 1970’s recession so horrible that everyone just swallowed “big government bad!” The country became more conservative, but the government didn’t shrink. We eliminated tariffs for trade (aka shrinking government) and a lot of those same people thought that was the worst thing in the world. I guess the obvious culprit is AM radio and Fox News but honestly I blame the baby boomer generation for being a bunch of entitled, lead poisoned dolts that never were left leaning btw (polls showed most young people supported the Vietnam war when it was going on), and not understanding that their success, for the most part, was completely set up for them.

In some cases, they even feed me a line about how “that’s what Russia wants us to do” and they begin sounding more and more like the Republicans we (meaning me and other liberals) used to criticize years ago. I mean, once upon I time there were liberals who went as far to say they wanted to slash the military budget in half (I know, I was one of them - Bill Maher was another)!

This gradual shift to where - at least from my perception - liberals went from questioning and challenging the establishment to seemingly embracing it has alienated me from the movement in recent years, and I’ve somewhat evolved into a socialist as they seem to speak more to these issues that I care about than liberals do in my experience.

56,Why do so many liberals say that it’s “impossible to be racist toward white people” when that’s objectively not true? Why does the left try so hard to not acknowledge that racism toward white people is possible?,"It wasn’t until recently that I’ve seen people go to such great lengths and do such complicated mental gymnastics to excuse racism toward white people. This post is only about personal racism, I’m not getting into anything systemic.

If we look at the definition of racism, which was already recently changed to make it skew more toward minorities during this recent surge of BLM activity, it says: 

“prejudice, discrimination, or antagonism directed against a person or people on the basis of their membership in a particular racial or ethnic group, typically one that is a minority or marginalized.”

But recently people have been saying “ACTUALLY it requires a power dynamic. ACTUALLY it can’t happen to white people. ACTUALLY it’s impossible because you can only be prejudice toward white people, not racist. ACTUALLY white people’s lives will never be harder because of their race so it’s impossible.”

However looking at the definition it doesn’t allude to anything even remotely close to “requiring a power dynamic” or anything. It doesn’t mention a color and even says “typically one that is a minority or marginalized.” The word “typically” of course meaning “not always,” implying once again that it can apply to a majority race, of course for example, white people. 

The argument that it’s “only prejudice and not racism” also makes no sense because the definition explicitly puts the word “prejudice” as one of the indicators for racism. 

I honestly just find myself bewildered because I can’t comprehend why people say it’s “impossible” for it to happen when the mere definition of the word dispels any and all argument I’ve seen from people on the left.  That’s the literal definition of the word, it’s not open to interpretation or any other rules or boundaries you feel like conveniently slapping on it to excuse your personal behavior.

To me it just seems like people will say anything to excuse it if it happens to white people, and why? What’s there to gain? If we just acknowledge that anyone can be racist we’re opening the door to move forward together in society. Why is the so much insistence that white people cannot be targets of racism?

I was frustrated with the lack of defense spending by european countries (not all, but some in particular like germany really ikred me). However, some people pointed out that even if they spent nothing the US would still be wise to stay in the organization. The rationale offered is that it kept the Russians and Chinese out of Europe (two countries hostile to US interests), it offers the US forward operating bases for operations in Africa and the Mid-east, if offers US power projection and multiplication (i.e. because NATO countries are heavily reliant on the US for defense, they are more likely to go along with key US interests, (If they didn't the US could pressure them into doing so through a variety of means.

Wonky introverted politicians are viewed in a negative light, whereas the flawed extrovert with ""good optics"" is celebrated. Politicians who make one mistake that isn't reflective of their governing ability are also demonized for ""bad optics"" (such as the case of the Dean scream). 

Politicians have to keep aspects about themselves in the closet in some instances (religious beliefs or lack thereof, mental condition, LGBT) because if they were open about them, it would be ""bad optics"". Other more visible aspects of a politician's identity can also affect their optics and how they're perceived, leaving them open to harsher judgement.

The wording of how a concept is explained can influence how people perceive a thing. Two identical ideas can have entirely different receptions, all depending on if it's ""good optics"" or ""bad optics"" .

The one time that I said I was conservative, I never heard from that friend again, despite reaching out multiple times. And when I speak to a conservative friend who supports trump, the racism gets so out of hand that I don’t respond and I lose them too. 

For example, any time we go to a house party or go out drinking, they all end up making fun of conservatives calling them stupid/racist/homophobic. Super baseline jokes and I’m not too sure if that’s how they really feel or not. They have no idea I’m conservative because I keep my mouth shut and appreciate and accept their opinions. Racism/homophobia is not me, but I do want to be open and honest with my friends without fear of being ostracized. 

The one time I said I didn’t think conservatives were all that bad, they thought it was a joke so I shut up. Every conversation I’ve had with my friends about politics, I find myself afraid to speak any sort of financially or otherwise conservative opinion in fear of being labeled as racist or homophobic.

&gt;To make visible the diversity of bodies, all of them sexed and valued. Reflection on images of different sexual persons in masculine and/or feminine, different ages, cultures, functional diversity … Recognition of child sexuality from birth by decriminalizing the recognition and experience of this sexuality at school and in the family (sexual vigilance, erotic games, etc.).
Encourage dialogue and trust in communication about sexual issues both at school and in the family as a factor in the prevention of child abuse.

The issue at hand was that the programme is mandatory in the province of Navarre and cannot be opted out of, regardless of what parents say. I feel that smearing opponents of apparent sexualisation of children as 'Far Right' is dishonest, to say the least.

If you add up those, all the farm subsidies, defense bills I believe he’s done more wealth redistribution than any other president. He signed a decent prison reform bill and apparently he did actually convince some republicans to vote for it (he later whined about it and regretted it). He killed TPP (it was dead in the Senate anyways) which is polarizing. I’m more of a free trade guy but it may be for the best that the US stayed out of it. We were the ones pushing for the corporations suing governments thing, and like all our trade deals we were pushing for a big pharma give away. The most heinous things he did were his quiet anti-lgbt bullshit, his disgusting pardons, his handling of Covid, anything immigration related, vetoing the end of US involvement in Yemen, hell, his entire job as president in 2020 stands out as exceptionally worse than the previous three. From 2017-2019 he wasn’t THAT much different from Bush or Reagan. Tax cuts and right wing judges. That sums it up before covid",AskALiberal,1609276853

4,Could Andrew Yang run as a Republican or Libertarian in the future,"Andrew Yang is a weird one. He's not a progressive like Bernie Sanders, more a centrist, but not like Biden though .  I don't think Andrew Yang would run against Biden or Kamala, he seems to get along with them fine; he could try to run against Trump but wouldn't want to split the vote like with [the election of 1912](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1912_United_States_presidential_election)  where Teddy Roosevelt split the progressive and liberal vote having the conservative win. **The post isn't about whether he will run as a republican but** ***what if*** **he did, and if he did could he win?** 

In terms of policy I really believe that he speaks to rural voters. Specifically in the counties Trump flipped in 2016. The reason xenophobia has grown so much is mainly due to the fact people like Trump  benefit from giving a name and a face to display rural problems. It just so happens that these faces are illegal immigrants, Muslims, Antifa, socialists, China or whatever. Yang seems to take a different approach to most Democrats -which seems to just be call people racist and Xenophobic for being... well racist and xenophobic- by instead blaming this problem on machines and inhumane capitalism. 

The biggest problem though is his social policies. He's not a ""ban all guns candidate"" but is in favor of gun control which in a primary could be used against him. Same with abortion and ""political correctness"" , a huge factor in conservative voting is social policies that in actuality are almost never regulated by the president. Yang could say something along the lines of ""The reason people get abortions is because childbirth costs to much, with M4A and the freedom dividend since more people would have financial security less abortions would happen."" Explaining things like that to a conservative audience might actually strike a cord. I've talked to many conservatives personally and when the topic of abortion comes up people despise it but think (in many cases) its necessary and we should strive for a society without abortions. 

Obamacare and Medicare 4 all are not as unpopular as you think. Most republicans like the single payer system and Medicare for all is also [not as unpopular](https://www.newsweek.com/69-percent-americans-want-medicare-all-including-46-percent-republicans-new-poll-says-1500187) as conservative outlets would have you believe. However the problem is just how you explain it. Conservatives make it seem like its unamerican, but get someone like Yang to explain it and it doesn't seem like scary communism anymore. 

Another factor in conservative thinking is how corrupt a candidate is. It sounds odd that the people who like Trump hate corruption but I digress. As a political outsider the ""corrupt"" card just wouldn't work on him like it does with Biden or Clinton. Of course you'll have people calling him flip floppy but he honestly doesn't fit into any party which is refreshing to many Americans. 

**TL:DR**  Yang stands for Humane Capitalism over Democratic Socialism. A political outsider who talks directly to the audience of Trump is a very good rebranding of the Republican party. He would have challenges with social policies and branding but I believe Yang could get over that in the eyes of the red party.",AskALiberal,1609260774

7,Why do you think it appears to be harder to change laws and culture today than in the past?,"Universal healthcare was passed by a bunch of countries in the 1940s, and lots of countries implemented the metric system in the past. The U.S hasn't implemented any of those, but we've implemented things like social security. 

None of those countries could probably implement any drastic change to society like UBI today. Nor could they probably implement any of those things I previously mentioned.

In the past, urban development could easily be Influenced. Cities quickly formed on trolley lines, and suburbs were normalized faster than the blink of an eye. 

But now we see the bad that comes with car dependent fields of nothing but single family homes and that pattern looks to be more entrenched and harder to change than any types of urban development in the past. 

By 1970, there were influential social movements that ushered in a while bunch of rights that weren't existent for certain people in 1900. All within a span of 70 years.

But modern day social movements don't appear to be making progress like the ones in the past, and seem to fizzle out easier. There are lots of academic theories in regards to how society should change, but none of them are known or embraced by broad society. Not much has changed since 1970, which was 50 years ago.

It remains remarkabl  for the first time in modern American history, a United States President, who has the world’s best resources at their disposal, continues to ignore their responsibility to ensure all American citizens are safe. Blaming others for  COVID-19, promoting fear, and using their powerful voice to undermine freedom of speech, scholarly facts in favor of unproven individual theories, conspiracy propaganda or outright lies, is not a value or characteristic the nation or world stage would ever expect from The President of the United States of America. 

In my opinion, Trump is the first modern President since the end of World War Two as the United States became without a doubt the leader of the free world to significantly diminish if not completely  lose our nations credibility and power. All former American President’s tirelessly worked to ensure that humbling privilege is not tarnished.

From my anecdotal experience (as somebody living in the bay area, going to University, arguably as much of a liberal bubble as can be had), it seems that liberal friends of mine that live in red states have a weirdly even more extreme/combative progressive views that even I do (and I'm no moderate). I'm not sure exactly how to characterize it but my running theory on why this is that progressive people in conservative areas have no access to a ""liberal"" culture (what ever that means) and so they turn to the internet as a proxy. It seems like my friends put a lot of stock into ""liberal internet culture"" as a model for liberalism whereas I have a community of people that are mostly all progressive which fosters (what I see) as a less hysterical for even-headed liberalism.

I feel that it's conventional wisdom that internet liberal culture isn't even close to being representative of the majority of democrats.

32,What do you think of american withdrawal from NATO?,"Hello,

So this is an issue I've been thinking about a lot recently. I recently had a discussion with someone who isn't from the us (they never actually said where they're from so idk). Anyways, I was trying to figure out how the us could get germany to spend more on its military to meet the 2% threshold it agreed to. Most of europe does not meet that 2% threshold. Right now, the biggest powers in europe are Germany and France. Neither currently meets the target (though in fairness France has the best military in Europe, so it's less of a concern for them). Anyways, the whole point of NATO these days is that it's a mutual defense treaty primarily aimed at deterring the Russians. I.e. if russia attacks the us, europe intervenes, if russia attacks europe, the us intervenes. This keepd countries like poland and estonia safe from russian intervention. That's obviously good, because it ensures stable democracies in the region, hems in an authoritarian russian regime, keeps europe peaceful and prosperous, and also (from the america point of view) gives us access to military bases in europe which can be used for power projection into africa and the middeast. This is important for fighting groups like ISIS or boko haram. For example, most us from operations in the mideast are run at the German Ramstein base.


Anyways, there is a very very common perception here in the US that europe is basically coasting off american defense spending and they feel they don't have to find their own militaries that well. The person I was talking to more or less admitted it and said the Germans had other priorities. This is true, but to be frank, NATO is a mutual defense treaty, both sides have to hold up their end of the deal. NATO members like Germany and France already agreed to the 2% threshold, and consistently fail to meet it. A lot of americans are beginning to wonder if the costs of NATO (in particular the potential of war with Russia) outweigh the benefits (a few bases and halfway decent protection). I personally want to see a closer relationship between europe and america and I think America has a lot to learn from Europe today, but on this one I do tend to side with the us. Europe isn't holding up it's end of the deal. Why? Because they know that the US is unlikely to leave NATO and because they know they have american protection. So, to solve this, should the US leave NATO? If not permanently, at least temporarily to demonstrate to europe that the us is tired of waiting around from them to find it in their budgets especially during a period of rising tension around the world. I see downsides here, like seriously damaging relationships with international allies which we frankly need right now, but idk how else to get europe to pay for their militaries. So, do you think the us should leave? Should we leave for a bit while europe ups spending to compensate for the loss of the us and rejoin? That seems to be the best solution to me cause it keeps nato in tact and gets europe to actually pay for its military but it is suuuuupppppeeerrr risky. What do you think?",AskALiberal,1609169343

I know the article is gated, so to briefly summarize:

* In 2016, high school student Mimi Groves sent a snapchat video to a friend in which she looks at the camera and says ""I can drive \[soft-r variant of the n-word\].""
* For whatever reason, this video was broadly circulated among classmates, reaching fellow student Jimmy Galligan sometime last year.
* Galligan saved the video, planning to publicly release it at a time that would cause maximum damage to Groves.  
* Over the summer, Groves posted on social media in support of the black lives matter movement (it seems from the article this may have partially triggered Galligan's actions, but it's not clear).
* After Groves was accepted to the University of Tennessee and its cheerleading team (a lifelong dream), Galligan publicly released the video.  Groves was then kicked off the cheer team and withdrew from the university ""under pressure from admissions officials.""
* Galligan expressed satisfaction to the New York Times about these events: ""If I never posted that video, nothing would have ever happened ... I’m going to remind myself, you started something ... You taught someone a lesson.""

39,When should the American people start to demand more equal representation in Congress?,"It’s been over 100 years since Congress has felt the need to create new congressional districts. In the 1970s, the threshold from 100k citizens per House of Representative's office was bumped to 700k. 

The demographics have changed significantly in some states. California and Texas are two states that are due to add districts because the population has increased. 

California’s 30+ million population started to climb in 1980 until today. 
 
The Texas metropolitan areas of Huston, Austin, and Dallas have expedition significantly growth. 

Adding additional  House of Representatives is essential now. We cannot keep Gerrymandering or readjusting the voting districts. 

Population growth and 100 years of zero growth in representation should be an understandable situation. 
The majority of Americans who live in the regions listed are within major metropolitan areas; the voter population is primarily blue. So, it is reasonably clear why people remain underrepresented. 

We must demand districts within the 700k threshold be broken down into multiple sections.

Lets take the working class (which form the majority) is it fair to say they are privileged and oppressing the billionaire class (which are technically a minority of the population)?

The idea that a majority cannot be oppressed does go against/contradicts left wing ideas like the working class being oppressed.

*If the KKK and Neonazis are in the 0th percentile and the Intersectional Body Positivity activists are in the 100th percentile: who is the 50th percentile and what is a summary of their beliefs?*


An example of what a summary could look like:
(This is to give you ideas and jog your memory. I have no idea what the average American is like. Make it as in depth or as limited as you want.)

* They support affirmative action, but only in very limited circumstances.

* They support racial justice movements up to the point of when the civil rights act was signed. They support the first two waves of feminism.

* They believe modern day feminism is an illegitimate movement who's main goal is not equality, but women's superiority.

* They don't think ""toxic masculinity"" is a thing, and believe restrictive gender roles for men are necessary for a strong society. They think gender equality is good because if women become more masculine, they'll be stronger.

* They think Black Lives Matter is too radical of a movement.

* They don't think racism is a legitimate problem, outside of a few groups like the KKK. 

* They support gay marriage from a legal standpoint. But objectify lesbians ""because they're hot"" and view gay men as gross.

* They don't believe that transgender people can legitimately change their gender, but are polite to them.

* They oppose Intersectionality. 

* They believe that white privilege exists. They believe that male privilege used to exist. They don't believe that heterosexual privilege, able bodied privilege, or christian privilege ever existed.",AskALiberal,1609082227

59,Do you think America’s blind love for the concept “freedom” be a major factor for why our pandemic response was so bad?,"Let me explain,

I, like many Americans value our freedom and cherish it. But where I differ is that I don’t allow it to blindside reality to the point of doing potential harm.

I have a personal theory that perhaps Americans love freedom so much, that even the smallest task like being asked to wear a mask or to socially distance is considered a violation of rights by certain groups of people in the US.

And as such, because the term freedom is so over romanticized in American lexicon and culture, that it can be used by people to label anything that causes inconvenience to them a taboo and a threat to freedom.

And that’s where I connect it onto my main argument. I think we can all agree the US’s response was majorly half assed. What I think personally is that it’s a mixture of public health experts and concerned citizens who want to contain the virus and prevent more death and infections clashing with the other part that doesn’t want to be inconvenienced by things like mask or social distancing and as such would rather we not have lockdowns or monitor community spread. And so because we have both of these elements, we ended up with a mostly ineffective response early on that seemed to draw out and fatigue people more while half-assing everything along the way.

So basically: virus begins to spread &gt; we need to contain it &gt; but we don’t want to temporarily give up our conveniences &gt; half measure policies that tries to compromise both sides &gt; virus begins spread rapidly &gt; repeat cycle

What do you think? Is blind love of freedom a big factor as to why our response was so bad? There is certainly a lot of other elements: disinformation, poor government response, lack of mass testing, virulence factor, etc. But I feel like this one might be a relatively big factor that explains why our response was so poor.",AskALiberal,1609051730

67,Whats your thoughts on the Social and Political Intersectional Sexism that Black Males face from Liberals?,"over the years I witness anti black male misandry from those who call themselves Liberals,  such as feminisy groups, LGBTQ groups, Democrats,  etc. Most of which i would have assumed would come from Conservative Republicans back in the day when I was first taught about politics as a child.     
           
But no, the majority of political attacks on Black Men been carried out by Liberals regardless of racial background or ethnicity.       
       
Looking at the recent election for example,  Black Men were the highest percentage of male voters for Joe Biden, yet all year along we saw Democrats attack Black Men. Black Men didn't even get a voice in their plight and solution,  because the Liberals turned any serious Black discussion into an entertainment party instead of a political tangible discussion as seen with the left attack on Ice Cube. It was as if. The Liberals were telling Black men to just shut up and vote.  Saw Tweets from celebrities like Janelle Monae viciously attack and disrespect Black Men, yet she gets no reprimand.        
       
[Here liberal politician Maxine Waters threaten Black Men over a small percentage of those that voted for Trump](https://moguldom.com/315252/maxine-waters-threatens-black-men-i-will-never-ever-forgive-them-if-they-vote-maga/)
, yet other ethnicities vote conservative on a much larger basis, such as immigrant groups, yet Maxine Waters holds no such threat towards non Black Males.       
        
On top of this, Black Men were attacked by liberal groups for not supporting Kamala Harris when she was running for president,  despite Black Women equally not supporting her.      

           
       
We can go back further then the election.        
The liberal site called ""The Root"" does many attacks on Heterosexual Black Males all the time. They once had an article called ""Straight Black Men are the White People of Black People"". Thats just one of many. But the anti black male misandry we see from Liberals remind me of the Anti Jewish propaganda we saw from socialist Nazis before they went full genocidal.       
        
In fact, looking over the last 40 years of politics here in the United States of America,  most damage to Black Men had been carried out by Liberal Politician, such as the racist war on drugs and mass incarceration,  both of which were supercharged by Liberals not Conservatives as many would have assumed.       
        
Looking back on all of this, why should Black Men even support Liberals? I believe one of the Black American leaders by the name of Malcolm X once said something of the same tune about the Liberals.       
       
This leads back to the topic of Intersectional Sexism that Black Men face.      
Based on many anti Black Male stereotypes going back to Antebellum Slavery.  Many Liberals say Black Men are the weakest link in one breathe but in the next breathe say Black Men have Male Privilege and are Patriarchs.      
Some Liberals scholars have even been propped up and misquoted to push the same narrative,  yet nowhere in American history have Black Families been a collective patriarchy. In fact Black families always been headed by the mothers and the women have always been more educated than the Black males. Most black politicians are also Black Women, not Black Men. Economic wise Black Men as a collective aren't doing better than Black Women or White Women.

11,Why have markets become so uncompetitive in America,"I recently read this article: [https://www.economist.com/briefing/2016/03/26/too-much-of-a-good-thing](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2016/03/26/too-much-of-a-good-thing)

Gonna be honest, I didn't understand it all (I'm 19 and have no investing experience, but hey, I'm trying to learn). Anyways, from what I can tell the article lays out these reasons:

1. Lack of anti-trust enforcement (due to a lot of reasons. Basically anti-trust are not allowed to consider certain subjects like whether patents are too long and extensive, issued too easily, etc. At the same time they have varied too much in thought over time. Like they used to consider a consolidation that would capture more than 35% of the market as problematic but in the 80s that changed).
2. Regulatory Capture (particularly patent stuff)
3. Investor preference for industries with ""moats"" 
4. High levels of corporate consolidation
5. Much smaller rates of small business formation/startups ([https://apnews.com/article/e7179fc8b9dc4399818f2038b75ec423](https://apnews.com/article/e7179fc8b9dc4399818f2038b75ec423), basically entrepreneurs struggled to find qualified workers and work through complex regulation. This isn't mentioned in the article, but I also believe our healthcare system plays a big role because if you leave your job in many cases you lose your healthcare, that's not a decision you can afford to take in many cases, especially if you need insulin for your kid or whatever. In the economist article it gives the same ideas but also throws in that they lack the capital to deal with lengthy court cases and to lobby, giving big business the win.)

So, to me, market consolidation/a lack of competition coupled with short-termism in investment thinking and business management is a huge huge huge source of America's economic woes. Is it the only source? No, the housing market is fucked up cause of zoning rules and NIMBYs, but this is a big one. It's behind a lot of joblessness, low-wages, waning union power and membership, etc. All of this can be traced back to these causes. So, how do we fix it? Here's what I'm thinking:

First off, we need to reform patent laws. To be honest, I'm still working out how exactly this would work because  I'm not super read up on patent law, however the patent system and patent trolls are such a big problem that it literally forced the massive company of Samsung to build and maintain an ice skating rink in a small texas town where most patent lawsuits are filed. That's right, an outdoor ice skating rink in **TEXAS**. If Samsung feels they have to do that, imagine how startups feel and operate? You think they can break into an industry full of patents. Huge companies have armies of patent lawyers and some companies are bought just for their patents so that other companies can't sue them. That's a problem, and a serious one. It means it is more profitable to buy a company with a lot of patents (even if that company is losing money) than like actually running a company profitably. 

The next big one is regulatory capture. This occurs largely thanks to lobbying and the expense of campaigns. It's a lot easier to capture regulation if you finance politicians that already agree with you. Find a guy who's super pro coal and help finance him to victory. That's your safety right there, prevents further regulation that will hurt you and can potentially keep new competitors out. Lobbying is another issue in and of itself. We need a complete list of lobbyists in Washington and a published list every time they meet with a politician. This is something Teddy Roosevelt actually proposed, funnily enough. I also just read an interesting idea from Brookings: [https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/06\_lobbying\_drutman.pdf](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/06_lobbying_drutman.pdf), have the library of congress publish an online website for public policy advocacy. I find this idea quite interesting and can easily see it combined with the published list idea. 

\#3 can't really be solved, it's just how investors are.

\#1/4 new anti-trust laws or at least updating our old ones. To be honest, anti-trust regulators cannot get around certain fundamental issues. They can't reform patent law, they can't reform corporate governance law, etc. That's congress's job. So, how do we address this? basically, congress needs to update its anti-trust rules for the 21st century. Perhaps we shouldn't allow apple to own both the IPhone and the App store. Perhaps, we shouldn't let amazon delve into every industry imaginable and compete with its own suppliers. That's on congress. Particularly patent law reform. We also need to go about better enforcement and have set guidelines that anti-trust enforcers will regularly use as well as a president who isn't afraid to use anti-trust enforcement.

\#5. This is again an issue of regulation, consolidation, regulatory capture and capital. If we solved the above issues, this would be solved for the most part. A stronger welfare state can certainly help with this.

Generally, the concept of intersectionality makes sense to me but I’m struggling to find it’s usefulness and, in fact, think it can be harmful. What I see is people are spliced up, categorized and grouped based on the intersection of things that define them, then those groups are ranked by most oppressed &gt; less oppressed. So, for example, a Black lesbian feminist would be closer to the top of the “victim chart” and the white cis male is near the bottom with their privilege. Suddenly, there is a sense that certain victims and more victimized than others and it seems intersectionality is used to shut down discussion—white cis men can’t have an opinion about issues that affect other groups, for example. 

Given that there are an infinite number of qualities that make up a person, isn’t the logical end point of intersectionality the individual, not the group? Since each person’s experience and situation is unique to them, it seems identity politics serves to divide people.

22,Why wasn't iceland's response to 2008 a horrible disaster?,"Hello,

Iceland responded to 2008 by basically letting its banks fail. The country as dominated by three huge banks that offered massive interest rates and saw a large influx of foreign capital (i think it was like 6x GDP). Anyways, when 2008 cam around, the banks failed and many bankers were thrown in prison. This resulted in massive business failures across the island. However, today Iceland is a fast growing economy which is actually set to repay its loans to the IMF early (idk if this is still the case after corona, but it was a year ago). Anyways, I quite like this approach because it prevents Moral Hazard like we've seen here in the US and abroad. However, it also led to small businesses across the island failing. I want to the US to learn from Iceland given that we're in the middle of a financial crisis now (though of a very different nature). Imagine the US had responded to 2008 the following way, would it have worked? What are the benefits and downsides that I may not be seeing

Response:

Let banks fail, and instead focus on bailing out small businesses. Set up a large scale fund that small businesses can apply for a loan from. This would ideally help prevent Moral hazard with the banks and learning from the Icelandic story whilst not screwing over small business in the US. At the same time, focus on prosecuting the bankers responsible for the crisis in the first place.

The major downside here is a collapse of the finacial system. That's obviously not great, but it's not like the stock market has been doing wonders for the average american recently and it would perhaps be better to not introduce further corruption and moral hazard into it.

Liberal values such as secularism but still have the freedom to practice your own religion without forcing others to bend to your viewpoint. The idea that people should have access to healthcare, the idea that government ought to create proper social safety nets in order to look out for the downtrodden in order to give people a fair shot in life, having basic empathy to realize that when global pandemics occur we need to ditch rugged individualism and perhaps maybe agree and understand that we have to behave as a unit in order to stop needless deaths and despair. Not having unnecessary wars (although isolationist conservatives will probably agree here).

30,What do you think about the CDC board recommending vaccinating essential workers ahead of elderly Americans?,"From an article by Yascha Mounk: [https://www.persuasion.community/p/why-im-losing-trust-in-the-institutions](https://www.persuasion.community/p/why-im-losing-trust-in-the-institutions)

On November 23rd, Kathleen Dooling, a public health official at the CDC, [gave a presentation](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/downloads/slides-2020-11/COVID-04-Dooling.pdf) to the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), which is tasked with developing the recommendation on who should first get access to the vaccine against Covid. In a stark departure from the course of action adopted in virtually every other developed democracy, Dooling recommended that 87 million essential workers—a very broad category including bankers and movie crews as well as teachers or supermarket cashiers—should get the vaccine before older Americans, even though the elderly are much more likely to die from the disease. The committee unanimously accepted the recommendations.

Dooling’s presentation laid out three different metrics for evaluating whether 87 million “essential workers” or Americans over the age of 65 should be next in line: feasibility, science, and ethics. According to the CDC's own evaluation, considerations of feasibility give us reasons to prioritize older Americans. This makes sense. It is both difficult to determine who should count as an essential worker and to communicate to people who do fall into that category that they are eligible. A straightforward age cut-off makes it easier to decide who's in and reach the target population. As a result, prioritizing the older 65s leads by this metric.

Considerations of “science” also seemed to point in the same direction. As the presentation acknowledged, the likelihood of dying from Covid strongly depends on age. According to the CDC’s model, prioritizing essential workers over the elderly would therefore increase the overall number of deaths by between 0.5% and 6.5%. In other words, it would likely result in the preventable deaths of thousands of Americans.

And yet, the presentation concluded that science does *not* provide a reason to prioritize the elderly. For, as Kathleen Dooling wrote in one of the most jaw-dropping sentences I have ever seen in a document written by a public official, differences in expected consequences that could amount to thousands of additional deaths are “minimal.”

This allowed Dooling to focus on “ethical” principles in selecting the best course of action. Highlighting the most important consideration in red, Dooling emphasized that “racial and ethnic minority groups are underrepresented among adults &gt; 65.” In other words, America’s elderly are too white to be considered a top priority for the distribution of the vaccine against Covid. It is on this basis that ACIP awarded three times as many points to prioritizing the more racially diverse group of essential workers, making the crucial difference in the overall determination. Astonishingly, the higher overall death toll that would have resulted from this course of action does not feature as an ethical reason to prioritize older Americans.",AskALiberal,1608775254

&gt; “As one of the largest pharmacy chains and wholesale drug distributors in the country, Walmart had the responsibility and the means to help prevent the diversion of prescription opioids,” Jeffrey Bossert Clark, acting assistant attorney general for the civil division, said in a statement. “Instead, for years, it did the opposite — filling thousands of invalid prescriptions at its pharmacies and failing to report suspicious orders of opioids and other drugs placed by those pharmacies.”

&gt; Walmart called the investigation “tainted” and said in a statement that the Justice Department should focus on “bad doctors” who write prescriptions instead of blaming the pharmacists that fill them.

For example, unemployment fell in the year following Trump's 2017 tax cut. Did it fall because of the tax cut or because of international factors outside of his control?

2. After more than 60 lawsuits were dismissed or withdrawn or lost due to lack of evidence of fraud, it's clearer than normal that election fraud isn't a big problem in U.S. elections.

People seem to be avoiding the sites with paywalls and instead relying further on objectively worse sources of information. Media companies are losing money, people don't want solid news, they want emotionally based opinion articles that agree with their preexisting biases. 

So my question is, what the hell should be done? What can be done? How can the right wing disinformation and propaganda bubble be popped? How do we encourage trustworthy and reliable news, and how do we encourage or teach media literacy?",AskALiberal,1608658891

Someone sent me this link as we were discussing affirmative action in the United States. There are two pieces of data that I find particularly interesting that I would like to obtain the liberal viewpoint on. 

I frequently hear from liberals that the sole reason that Asian-Americans are successful (i.e. have the highest rates of wealth among minorities, higher educational achievement) are that immigrants came here wealthy. While this is true, I believe that this viewpoint totally discounts ethnic culture and its effect on educational outcomes.

Another view I frequently hear is that systemic oppression of blacks and Latinos are one of the primary causes of the success of Asians as Asian-Americans are a benefactor of this system as a side-effect. However, if you scroll to the bottom and make your own mobility chart on the website, it shows that Asian-Americans from all wealth classes have higher rates of both upward mobility and staying rich compared to white Americans. As most lawmakers are white males, I do not believe that they would set up a system that prefers Asians and oppresses their own race in regards to upward mobility and wealth. I believe there is something else at play here, i.e., culture.

This links supports the evidence that Asians are on average more wealthy than white Americans. And this leads to my questions that I am very interested in hearing your viewpoint on. I want to preface that I've seen enough evidence to know systemic racism exists in terms of law enforcement/the prison system among black and Latino communities. I've seen some evidence of this in the educational system as well, but am a lot less convinced that systemic racism is 100% the cause of wealth disparity and the differences of rates of higher educational achievement between different races. I believe that ethnic culture and the values that a certain culture places on education also plays a role, which liberals tend to ignore.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Do you believe culture has played a role in the wealth disparity / and rates of higher educational achievement between Asian-Americans and whites?
2. Do you believe an African-American culture exists? If so, do you believe that for the same reasons as question 1, that culture may play a role in the wealth disparity / and rates of higher educational achievement in the black community in the United States?",AskALiberal,1608652810

   * I'm a bit on the fence about this one.
* Striking against neutral employers to coerce an associated third-party employer (secondary action)
   * It seems unfair to that neutral employer to have to deal with a strike from employees who have no real quarrel
* Forcing the hiring of unnecessary workers (featherbedding)
* Picketing for recognition for more than 30 days without scheduling a certification election
   * What's wrong with this restriction? Isn't certification the whole point of recognition strikes?
* Striking by unionized workers without union approval (wildcat strike)
   * This undermines the union as well as the employer
* A union restraining or coercing employees in the exercise of their rights or an employer in the choice of its bargaining representative
* A union causing an employer to discriminate against an employee
* A union refusing to bargain with the employer of the employees it represents
   * It is also illegal for an employer to refuse to bargain with his employees' union. This provision makes it cut both ways.
* A union requiring excessive dues
* Strikes by federal employees
   * This right here is why Reagan busted PATCO in 1981. I can understand a need to prevent undue interruption of federal activity.
* Striking or picketing a health care establishment without giving the required notice

* Abolishing high-level academic courses by 2023 if the performance of black students is not on par with non-blacks. 
*  Overhauling the entire curriculum, reading lists and student plays to reflect diversity and social justice themes 
* Paying the student debt of black staffers upon hiring them.

There are some changes that, at least seem more fair if its just about tackling racism, such as:

&amp;#x200B;

* Assigning a staffer dedicated to black students who have “complaints or face disciplinary action,” and a full-time advocate to help black kids “navigate a predominantly white institution.”
* Requiring courses that focus on “Black liberation” and “challenges to white supremacy.” 

I don't have a problem with black and white students learning about white supremacy and black liberation. I want all of our students to know the true history of our country and how it was (and still is) very difficult for black people. I am also not against using resources to assist black families who may need it when financial or racial issues arise within the school.

After the podcast’s release in 2018– Canadien Parliament demanded an investigation because he told them conflicting stories— and Canadien journalists reached out to the Times with their concerns that he was lying. The host of the podcast— the star terrorism reporter for the NYT— criticized Canadien law enforcement and defended the story.

2 years later the subject was arrested and then NYT opened an internal investigation. They not only found he was lying but there was a lack of due diligence in initial research. The podcast moved forward despite not even being able to confirm that he had ever been to Syria.

*Most* of the podcast was retracted. The NYT gave an apology (claiming they ‘fell in love’ with the story and didn’t “listen hard enough” to the accusations of lying). The awards were returned or rescinded. And the reporter was reassigned.

It is unclear if vaccines will work against it. There is high hope, but there's no information on this currently. Head scientists don't seem too worried about vaccines not working against it. I'm curious on Fauci's thoughts.

So - if the new strain makes its way to the US, our hospitals will once again be overwhelmed. This is assuming that not enough people are vaccinated, or that vaccines are ineffective against the new strain.

Naturally, a new lockdown would be needed to stem the spread. And due to the highly contagious nature of this new strain, the lockdowns would need to be much more strict. For reference, the new strain is about 70% contagious than current strains floating around the world.

In order to support strict lockdowns, new stimulus would be needed to keep people alive and afloat. If, and IF, the vaccines don't work, the stimulus would be need to be ongoing until a new vaccine can be adjusted to respond to this new strain, which would take around half a year to produce and distribute.

What would be a good package to support Americans and prevent collapse of groups around the country? I think 2 CARES package size stimulus plans would be needed, pegging around $6 trillion. I believe these would be able to be distributed easily under Biden and even the senate due to the highly contagious nature of the new strain.

7,A sustainable and powerful middle class collectively is the Americans Dream. When did so many citizens in this demographic become so self-righteous their values or political interests are paramount over another citizens of the same demographic ?,"The Americans middle class, Republicans or Democrats, need a healthy reality check. The middle-class lifestyle that exists today is not precisely because of anything remotely related to an individual. 

What remains important to remember is the middle-class majority of today is very much a new class. Until the Great Depression, the American economy and lifestyle were significantly repented among rich or poor. The federal government policy shifts implemented by liberal Democratic FDR created the only incredibly impactful opportunity giving Americans the ability to build wealth. 

When Americans achieve a generation or two living a sustainable middle-class life with many owning a home, access to education and good labor benefits - the ideology who remained angry about FDRs actions that elevate millions out of poverty into a position if of collective power that equalizes society to prevent a handful of influential citizens owning the future for the majority under their control- the same group of citizens who achieve an extraordinary life quickly began to think they are self Made success stories - is about the time the ideology gained momentum that big government is wrong. Trickle-down economics it’s best to achieve a sustainable future. 

Meanwhile, many believed this idea that started the division among the middle class. Unions found themselves weaker, Pensions once common replaced with riskier 401k that saving profits for stakeholders, and many regulations removed that ensured middle-class protections. Laws that prevented one owner or group producing news or important in TV or print media from owing multiple outlets to report information in a region or once cable television arrived failed to ensure news networks have to follow broadcast networks rules Required on stories to be told from the position of neutrality if not the story from both angles during the same newscast opened the door for propaganda. 

Meanwhile,  No tangible results remotely benefited the middle class or now growing poverty class lacking resources once available to grow into a better life.  The only reason the middle class had the perception of More remains rooted among the most significant impact on middle-class Americans. The two-income families were fast becoming a requirement to sustain a consistent lifestyle.  

Even after entering another round of continued Ideology that once again Proved to hurt the majority in 2008, the American people seem to be more divided into issues that have zero impact on middle-class sustainability.  Citizens who are under the impression gun rights are a significant issue and distort reality, which causes an emotional vote over a realistic option that benefits economic activity or middle-class citizens, remains completely selfish. 

Democrats who continue to drive the bus on the thin line of center-right over the liberal Democratic plan achieve almost all the advancements weakened. When did it become remotely helpful to see news anchor regularly remind views - a group of middle-class citizens who vote for Republicans lacks college education - it’s a factor, but it does not need to be repeated. It is a  constant reminder that  puts a line it division. If Democrats can only count in highly educate citizens voting then that’s a failure. The last two Dem Presidents assumed their magic would win over all to see the light. However, real liberal policy that had tangible results for middle class Americans has not occurred since LBJ.  

We cannot achieve a middle class unity that demands policy that is bigger then Party or individual throughs.  We need reforms on Wall Street and refocus our attention towards Main Street policy that remains focused on the local communities is long overdue. 

The division we have today is all a distraction to keep the majority of middle-class citizens busy on non-issues over the issues that impact all middle-class Americans.  
We need to end this idea that makes many feel their non-issue emotional ideology is more important than collective policy that helps everyone.",AskALiberal,1608452125
8,Is Social Justice More Important Than Saving Lives?,"In their recommendations for deploying the new COVID vaccines the CDC is balancing a lot of factors.  One of the factors is that people 65 and over are disproportionately white.  And that is listed as a reason to not prioritize their vaccination even though doing so would likely save the most lives.  Here are some articles discussing the matter.  The first give a broader overview with both side of the argument, and the second advocates for immunizing the elderly first.

It's all very complicated and I don't envy the people that have to make these decisions, and it's also important to note that the states themselves don't have to follow CDC recommendations and will decide how the vaccinations are actually distributed.

Not only has Trump brought more peace to the Middle East, more comprehensively and faster than all of his predecessors combined, but he made it look easy. Israel's ties with its Abraham Accords partners are expanding massively by the day. Tourists from the UAE are streaming into the country. And with one in seven Israeli Jews descended from the Moroccan diaspora, the potential for business and cultural ties between Israel and Morocco is almost limitless.""

26,How would you evaluate this statement on lending practices by Thomas Sowell?,"I am researching the debate between liberals and conservatives concerning systemic racism. I am seeing that most liberals emphasize systemic injustice as a cause of racial inequalities, whereas conservatives like to emphasize individual decision-making and cultural factors. I am at this point in the dialectic:

Liberals: Redlining was an evil racist policy that targeted poor black neighborhoods and perpetuated their poverty.

Conservatives: But redlining was made illegal in the 60s.

Liberals: Still, we are living with the effects of redlining, and presently existing policies, even if they aren't explicitly racist, perpetuate these negative effects.

Conservatives: But banks lend more to Asian Americans more than to white Americans; yet we don't say that banks are discriminating against whites in favor of Asians. By parity of reasoning, the fact that banks lend more to whites than to blacks does not entail that banks are discriminating against blacks in favor of whites.

And then they cite this Thomas Sowell quote from *The Housing Boom or Bust*:

&gt;Including the differential mortgage loan approval rates between Asian Americans and whites shows that the same methods to conclude that that blacks are discriminated against in mortgage lending would also lead to the conclusion that whites are discriminated against in favor of Asian Americans, reducing this whole procedure to absurdity, since no one believes that banks are discriminating against whites...""\[W\]hen loan approval rates are not cited, but loan denial rates are, that creates a larger statistical disparity, since most loans are approved. Even if 98 percent of blacks had their mortgage loan applications approved, if 99 percent of whites were approved than by quoting denial rates alone it could be said that blacks were rejected twice as often as whites.

28,What should be the democrats position on gun control?,"I noticed there was a big debate in the post about how the democrats could win more down-ballot races about whether the democrats should run candidates that are pro-gun in more conservative areas, or change their overall stance on gun issues. What do you think?

I mention this because there are a lot of single issue pro gun voters in states where democrats performed poorly in the 2020 election, who will never vote for a politician who supports gun control.

Personally, I think it makes sense. If the democrats focus on issues that matter most on a day to day basis to most working class people, such as healthcare, education, wages, unions, etc, and dropped gun control and other things like defund the police and political correctness, they would have a much better chance of winning down ballot races. I think even if you talked to most people in area like the rust belt or pennsyltucky, they would agree that wages are too low, housing costs are too high, education is too expensive and the healthcare system is broken. But they aren't hearing the democrats talk about these issues enough compared to issues like gun control, social justice, defund the police, trans rights etc. 30-40 years ago, there used to be a bunch of pro-gun democrats in congress. Now, it seems like there are very few, if any. Allowing candidates who better reflect the social values of their constituents may increase their chances of being elected, which in turn would increase the chances of the democrats passing things like healthcare reform.

Another thing the democrats could do is change their stance on gun control. One thing I've noticed is that democrats seem to be very focused on banning things, and have championed the assault weapons ban as their main piece of gun control legislation. However, backing bans on weapons makes it very easy for republicans to say that democrats are 'trying to take your guns away.' Instead, democrats could favor different proposal that may be both more effective and more easy to be passed. For example, instead of pushing to outright ban certain weapons, you could push for the creation of licenses, which in order to obtain you have to go through a mental health check and safety/training program.",AskALiberal,1608403044

31,"Are you more authoritarian or libertarian? In your opinion, when is a policy too authoritarian/too libertarian?","I believe general libertarian doctrine is good. Do not infringe on individual rights or liberties as long as they don't infringe on anyone else's. As a more left leaning libertarian I believe in more ""negative rights."" For example, if I get into a car accident that severs my left arm, I have the right to not worry about being refused medical treatment or financial ruin. Typically, left libertarians think the state should take a hands off approach to individual liberties and regulate the marketplace more. However, there's fallacies there as well. For example, we treat mentally challenged people as second class citizens essentially and restrict their freedoms more than you would a normal person. I asked r/libertarian if they believed mentally disabled or blind people should be allowed to drive, and they unsurprisingly said no. They believe your right to go outside and not be run over by a blind or mentally challenged person is more important than their freedom to drive. In other words, a negative right. 

  There's other cases where a libertarian approach is necessary even if something is genuinely damaging to society. Case in point: child abandonment. Most agree than child abandonment is morally wrong, and I may even consider it child abuse. Make no mistake, by refusing to have any involvement in your child's life you ARE harming them. Emotionally, financially, etc. Child abandoners also, as a whole degrade society as children from single parent homes are more likely to commit crimes in adulthood than their two-parent counterparts, and single parents are less likely to climb out of poverty. Foster homes aren't much better. In spite of all this, you should ABSOLUTELY have the right to abandon your child if you wish. Making it illegal would mean by having a child, you automatically lose your right to freedom of movement. The right to do what you want with your life. That is an extreme restriction of personal liberty. On top of that, I don't think it's even feasible. A father sires another child with another woman who lives somewhere else, what happens then? Overall, everyone has an authoritarian instinct. I personally would be happy if Biden sends in the national guard to force everyone to wear masks and actually enforce fines even if people have their noses out. I wish everyone was forced to take the vaccine as well.

70,How did we even get here as a country?,"Don’t get me wrong. Trump had to go. I’m glad that he’s leaving in a month and glad that he will no longer be POTUS. But something hit me. How did we even let that happen as a country? How did someone as destructive as him become president of the United States? This is a question I’d like to know. 

At first I found Trump’s charades of refusing to concede amusing. Try to overturn the results all you want I said. It’ll get you nowhere. But this isn’t funny anymore. Trump’s attacks become even more aggressive and he’s taken it even further than just dubious lawsuits and misinformation. Getting Texas involved to try to overturn the results. Meeting with Michigan Republicans to try to block Biden’s win there. It just hit me that what we’re witnessing is something the United States has never seen before. A sitting president trying to illegally overturn the results of a fair election in which the people decide who represents us. What’s even more terrifying is that Trump has enablers. There are Republicans who are urging him to keep “fighting”. His supporters also adore it and legitimately believe that election fraud took place. Even though it’s been investigated several times and nothing was found. Trump’s base seems to believe his lies and conspiracies more than they do facts. This is a little concerning going forward and puts a dent in democracy hopefully short term, not long term. 

How was it possible that the US elected someone who was the closest thing to a tyrant that America has seen? I mean we can shame Trump supporters all we want. We call them stupid. Misinformed. Evil if they actually like the things he says and does. But there’s gotta be a deeper reason. Is the media to blame? Conservative pundits never report factual news. They pander to their audience and push these conspiracy theories because that’s what they want to hear. The liberal media at times can come off as smug and condescending towards Trump supporters. Which could be further angering them. Every time I criticize Trump I get told by someone who likes him to “stop watching CNN”. Even when I myself don’t watch CNN at all. I can make my judgment of Don the Con of my own without the media influencing me. 

Getting rid Trump is a start. He was part of the problem. A big part of it. But sadly he’s not THE problem. The fact that a guy like him was even elected in the first place is going to sit with us for quite some time. As long as Donald keeps squawking about election fraud Joe Biden is going to have a difficult task of uniting a country that is deeply divided. The majority of Trump supporters will not trust him, believing that he stole the election from their cult leader. It’s terrifying that they let their hatred of democrats get the best of him and enabled something that is pretty close to fascism. They need to take some pointers from Bush Sr. While he was disappointed that he didn’t win he accepted defeat, handled it with class and congratulated Bill Clinton on his victory. The Republican Party has seemed to have lost all of that. Trump’s defeat was supposed to be a clear message to all of his supporters and his enablers in congress.

99,How does Rhine Capitalism differ from Social Democracy and Anglo-Saxon style capitalism?,"I know that sweden is a social democracy and I have another post on here about whether or not germany would be considered one. However, as I understand it the tax burden (at least for income taxes) is actually lower in Germany than in Sweden. Germany also has a very strong labor movement and co-determination. However, i do see that some people don't tend to lump it in with the nordic model. It seems that Rhine capitalism is a mixture of Anglo-Saxon capitalism and the nordic model. How does it differ from both? I'm quite interested for a number of reasons. First off, Germany is the economic heart of Europe so obviously it's doing quite well. I think there is a lot the US can learn from that. Second, I understand the importance of taxation for funding the welfare state and I absolutely do want a very strong one, but a) I don't see it as possible to raise taxes in the US sufficiently to fund it properly because of republicans and because of the general political climate (cut to dumpster fire). Third, as a red-blooded freedom loving american I understand the aversion to high income taxes, so since Germany has a lower tax burden than Sweden it seems like a compromise I and many other americans would be willing to make (though again, if need be, I would be fine with Sweden level taxation, I'd just like to see if there are ways we can lower the tax burden a bit in the US for both pragmatism and just to prevent super high taxation. I doubt the US will ever become a Swedish style taxed country just because of that high aversion to taxation. But hey, if I have to pay Swedish level taxes so that everyone can get healthcare, I'd absolutely be willing to, I'm not that selfish). Also, I am aware that taxes were higher in the past (70% marginal tax rate under Eisenhower), but now isn't the past and I don't think that we can actually implement that. AOC tried and well, republicans didn't allow that did they? Fourth, I think that a Rhine Style capitalist system/a social democracy may solve a lot of our internal issues. I am particularly interested in the German apprentice program. If there are any germans on here, I would love to hear more about how that went and any dislikes/changes you would have made to it. Anyways, a stronger labor movement here in the states could advocate for higher wages and such. Couple that with a stronger federal government and stricter enforcement of anti-trust and you have a competitive market with high wages. Now, obviously some jobs will be shipped overseas, but to deal with that you have the welfare state. There is something I think the US can take from the swedish nordic model though, the program (i forgot it's name) where you can take 5 months off of work to start a company without losing your job. If you are a swede and have participated in that program, please tell me about it! I am curious because it seems like it could do wonders to promote entrepreneurship here in the states and allow for more competitive markets. Regardless, Germany and Sweden have a lot of stuff I think Americans could adapt, but I'm trying to work out internal difference between the models and what is effective from each. 

Anyways, I'd love to hear your thoughts. I am coming around the belief that Rhine capitalism is more applicable to America than a Swedish style Social Democracy, but I am still learning and still working things out. If I am incorrect in my above statements, please let me know, as I would like to learn!

&gt; President-elect Joe Biden will nominate Pete Buttigieg to be his secretary of transportation, elevating the onetime rival to a key role in the incoming administration’s push to rebuild American infrastructure and the economy, according to three people familiar with the decision.

&gt; The former mayor of South Bend, Ind., dropped out of the presidential race and endorsed Biden at a critical moment in March ahead of the Super Tuesday primaries. Shortly afterward, an emotional Biden compared the former intelligence officer for the Navy Reserve, who served a tour in Afghanistan, to his son Beau, who died of brain cancer at age 46.

&gt;“It’s the highest compliment I can give any man or woman,” Biden said then, citing Buttigieg’s “moral courage” and “backbone like a ramrod,” predicting a long and bright future. “I promise you, you’re going to end up, over your lifetime, seeing a hell of a lot more of Pete than you are of me.”",AskALiberal,1608059030

29,How I think Trump supporters will regard Trump a year from now,"I read a book called *They Thought They Were Free* that contains interviews with ordinary Germans just after World War 2. Some of them were Hitler apologists. They said that Hitler had good intentions but was betrayed by his duplicitous underlings (Himmler, Goering, etc.), and that his main fault was that he was too innocent and naive to see the treachery in these men. I expect to see something similar with Trump supporters. As they slowly start to accept all the corruption and mismanagement that happened in the Trump era, they will say that it was Trump's corrupt and incompetent subordinates who did all those things behind his back, and that Trump was a well-meaning man who tragically did not understand the depths of evil in Washington.

Here's an excerpt from Chapter 3

&gt; None of my ten friends, even today, ascribes moral evil to Hitler, although most of them think (after the fact) that he made fatal strategical mistakes which even they themselves might have made at the time. His worst mistake was his selection of advisers—a backhanded tribute to the Leader’s virtues of trustfulness and loyalty, to his very innocence of the knowledge of evil, fully familiar to those who have heard partisans of F. D. R. or Ike explain how things went wrong.

&gt; Having fixed our faith in a father-figure—or in a father, or in a mother or a wife—we must keep it fixed until inexcusable fault (and what fault of a father, a mother, a wife, is inexcusable?) crushes it at once and completely. This figure represents our own best selves; it is what we ourselves want to be and, through identification, are. To abandon it for anything less than crushing evidence of inexcusable fault is self-incrimination, and of one’s best, unrealized self. Thus Hitler was betrayed by his subordinates, and the little Nazis with him. They may hate Bormann and Goebbels—Bormann because he rose to power at the end, and they are ashamed of the end; Goebbels because he was a runt with a “Jewish mind,” that is, a facile and cunning mind unlike theirs. They may hate Himmler, the Bluthund, above all, because he killed in cold blood, and they wouldn’t do that. But they may not hate Hitler or themselves.

&gt; “You see,” said Tailor Schwenke, the littlest of my ten little men, “there was always a secret war against Hitler in the regime. They fought him with unfair means. Himmler I detested. Goebbels, too. If Hitler had been told the truth, things would have been different.” For “Hitler” read “I.”

&gt; “The killing of the Jews?” said the “democratic” bill-collector, der alte Kämpfer, Simon. “Yes, that was wrong, unless they committed treason in wartime. And of course they did. If I had been a Jew, I would have myself. Still, it was wrong, but some say it happened and some say it didn’t. You can show me pictures of skulls or shoes, but that doesn’t prove it. But I’ll tell you this—it was Himmler. Hitler had nothing to do with it.”

&gt; “Do you think he knew about it?”

&gt; “I don’t know. We’ll never know now.”

&gt; Hitler died to save my friend’s best self.

&gt; Apart from the partially and secretly anti-Nazi teacher, only the bank clerk, Kessler, the natively eloquent little man who became an official Party speaker in the county, seems to have had any shadow of doubt about Hitler’s personal or public goodness—and even he may be projecting his own experience: “Hitler was a spellbinder, a natural orator. I think he was carried away from truth, even from truth, by his passion. Even so, he always believed what he said.” “The schemers, Himmler, Goebbels, Rosenberg, Bormann—they built him up into a man of destiny,” said Salesman Damm, the Party office manager in Kronenberg. “They did it so skilfully that he finally believed it himself. From then on, he lived in a world of delusion. And this happened, mind you, to a man who was good and great.” It could happen to me, Heinrich Damm, too.",AskALiberal,1608010678

&gt;Trump revealed the move on Twitter, writing that he and Barr had a “nice meeting” at the White House, and Barr would “be leaving just before Christmas to spend the holidays with his family.”

&gt;Trump claimed, “Our relationship has been a very good one, he has done an outstanding job!” — though Trump had expressed frustration with Barr in recent days because Barr did not reveal before the election that Hunter Biden, President-elect Joe Biden’s son, was under investigation by the Justice Department.

43,Do we really want more training for police?,"I highly recommend looking into the story of the first medically trained [EMTs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_House_Ambulance_Service). It used to be police duty to shuttle people to the hospital after someone called 911 with a medical emergency. They would just show up and take them to the hospital. The philosophy here was that people in medical emergencies needed to see doctors as soon as possible, and the best way to do that was to get them in a cop car, put on the siren, and race to the hospital to drop the person off. This caused lots of problems, particularly in minority neighborhoods where police, (especially in the 50s and early 60s) were overtly racist and constantly threatening the citizens there with arrest. If a dirty cop has been trying to get someone falsely arrested for some time, then that person breaks their leg, are they supposed to call the cops on themselves and voluntarily get into the back of the cop car?

As a result of this, people in these minority neighborhoods had horrible health outcomes, simply because they wouldn’t use emergency medical services. In response to this, the first EMS was founded in a minority neighborhood in Pittsburgh exclusively staffed by African Americans. (How is this story not more well known?) Also, and this is a **key** point, these newly created EMTs got medical training. People began to quickly realize, that *not only* was this a good solution for minority neighborhoods who are dubious of calling the police, but it was a good solution for everyone. It simply hadn’t occurred to anyone in society at the time that you might want someone trained in CPR, bracing broken bones, administering an iv, etc. to come to your door in an emergency. This success was clearly visible in hindsight, even if no one wanted EMTs before they were invented. Now, ambulances with medically trained EMTs are an expectation. Young people don’t know they are a new invention from the 60s, and until recently I was one of them.

What happened here? Well prior, we had 2 emergency services people could call to get a civil servant responding: the police and the fire department. These were the tools in our proverbial toolbag. Given the tools at the time, police were the best tool for the job, but really, police were the wrong tool for the job. What was needed was a new tool, EMS, to be created. I see the same need again. We as a society need to get real about what cops are. Cops are an emergency response civil servant who has a gun, bullet proof vest, and combat training. How often is that tool the appropriate response in society? Is a gun, bullet proof vest, and combat training the appropriate response to two neighbors squabbling over one neighbor's dog pooping in the other's lawn? I’d say clearly no. Is a gun, bullet proof vest, and combat training the appropriate response when someone needs a welfare check? I’d say clearly no. Is a gun, bullet proof vest, and combat training the appropriate response when someone rolls a stop sign? I'd say clearly no. We need to add another tool to our proverbial tool belt so that we can handle these problems more effectively. 

My proposition is a civil servant who is given training which covers all the ordinances and codes of the city, as well as all the social and welfare programs, while getting training in deescalation and effective communication. These people will have no guns, and no ability to detain/arrest, just the ability to issue a citation. They would handle all parking and traffic violations, deal with homelessness, enforce businesses who don’t comply with health codes to shut down, perform wellness checks, mediate squabbles between neighbors over the dog, respond to noise complaints, etc. Talk to a police officer about what they do on a random day and you will find that, for the majority of their work, a civil servant with a gun, bullet proof vest, and combat training is not the appropriate response. We need to respond appropriately to those scenarios.

The goal here is to make police a response we **only** use when it is appropriate. Sometimes, an on-call civil servant with a gun, bullet proof vest, and combat training is **absolutely** the appropriate response. Domestic abuse, stalking, gang violence, robberies, etc. The goal is to have cops be exclusively used in scenarios where they are appropriate. Seems reasonable right? If we *reduce* police training to focus on scenarios where a gun and bullet proof vest are needed, we allow them to get good at handling those scenarios, which is what we want. By piling on more and more training to handle a wider and wider array of potential scenarios ranging from gang violence to welfare checks, we dilute the effectiveness and skill we need from police.

The hidden benefit we need to keep in our mind after leaning about EMS is that these newly trained civil servants will likely solve many significant problems that *we don’t even frame as problems now*. Remember, it *simply hadn’t occurred to anyone* that society might want a medically trained person responding to medical emergencies, and yet those benefits are immense and taken for granted now. What problems will be solved when we have this new tool in the toolbag?

Let’s think about why this happened and other potential solutions which could have happened. Many people here are calling for increased police training into deescalation and communication, and applying that to our EMS scenario here, that would be like adding EMT training to a cop's training regimen. Sure, if cops were trained as EMTs, we wouldn’t need ambulances, we could carry on as we had with police shuttling people to the hospital, now with much better health outcomes due to their medical training. I think we would all agree that this is the wrong solution and ambulances were the correct solution. The key to success here is not just that they are medically trained, but that they are **specialized** in medical training. They receive no combat training. They are not equipped with guns and a vest. I challenge the people here calling for more police training to consider if we would be better off without ambulances, but rather with cops with EMT training. Is that the best tool for the job? 

There are also many instances of police brutality of late where this wouldn’t help. The scenarios which lead to the police killings are often scenarios where a person with a gun and vest actually is the appropriate response. In these cases, we are using the correct tool (armed police), but we are using that tool incorrectly. I believe police will get better at handling situations where they are the appropriate response, if they are exclusively used in those scenarios, and don't have to worry about conducting effective welfare checks, or bothering themselves with how to deescalate a neighborly dispute. I agree with the consensus among liberals that we misuse the tool of police often, and I think we should asses and think about how we use the tool, but much more fundamentally, I think we need to asses if police are even the right tool to use in the first place.

It strikes me that I've seen this setup play out in movies and in real life plenty of times. I'm told a friend's parents are ""old-fashioned"" and that I should understand that they grew up in a different time or something like that....

59,Would you prefer educational equality of opportunity even if it meant a net negative impact on the education system?,"Let's say you completely abolished using property taxes for education, all educational funding is centralized to the state. Student costs are distributed equally. All school systems are a lottery and rich kids are shipped to poor neighborhoods to improve those schools scores. And poor kids are shipped to rich schools to lower their scores. Fundraising is also equalized because more rich kids in historically poor schools, and more poor kids in historically rich schools. Low income parents have more social interaction with wealthy parents and possibly more business connections. Low income students would spend more time wealthy kids and vice versa. 

But this comes with drawbacks. More travel time is required for students. So a student might have to travel a half hour to an hour each way in suburbs, cutting down their free time by as much as 50%. Kids may be seperated from their friends on weekends and after school because their friends live farther apart. Kids are more likely to be transferred away from their friends when graduating through schools. Some wealthier parents won't be happy with the change and will send their kids to private school, these parents also are the biggest donators, and instead of donating to a public system, they are now donating to a private system. The test scores for the lowest achievers would increase, but the overall average test scores would drop.

When my very conservative friend explained his frustration regarding the $15 minimum wage pay increase, I understood and didn't have an answer for him. This is why I'm coming to you. 

His concern was this: His wife is an LPN who is making between $18-$19/hour. She has a ton of experience and schooling under her belt. With this increase, she'd only be making $3-$4 more than a 16-year-old working at Burger King. 

Will her pay also be increased proportionally to accommodate her education and experience?

Or are all of her years slowly getting incremental raises just thrown out the door?

How will companies afford to pay their employees more? 

Won't the costs of their products and services rise to accommodate the pay increase and then we're just back to where we started?

Will the government help those companies with the increase?

How does this work?

Their study basically concluded that socioeconomic factors play a larger role. (According to this user I couldn't actually read it)

Text:  
When I talk about what contemporary US conservatives are doing (to wit: being f'ing horrible), I'm frequently told, ""don't call them conservatives. They are fascists/thugs/racists/etc."" Let's talk about that.  

The impulse behind the response is to separate what people think of as philosophical conservatism -- small gov't, strong defense, traditional values -- from the kind of incoherent morass of resentments &amp; cruelties we see on the right today.  

But that's the wrong way to think about it. The nationalism, anti-intellectualism, xenophobia, resentment, cruelty, &amp; lust for authoritarianism did not, at some point, displace conservatism. They are simply what conservatism becomes in the face of demographic change.  

At root, conservatism is an impulse of those on the inside -- racially, economically, etc. -- to protect the status quo that privileges them. It is an impulse in every society that has an inside -- ie, all of them.  

When the insiders feel comfortable &amp; relatively secure in their position, justifications for the status quo tend to take on a high-minded philosophical character, to express in terms of principles, immutable truths, etc. And when insiders feel secure, they can be *magnanimous*...  

... about allowing various Others to enjoy some of society's fruits. This is ""compassionate conservatism"" &amp; ""economic opportunity zones"" &amp; etc. ""We at the top are broad-minded, we are willing to extend some largesse to the subalterns.""  

But when the status quo comes under real threat, when the demographic &amp; class groups on the inside feel real pressure, when other groups show signs of obtaining &amp; wielding real power ... the high-mindedness &amp; magnanimity rapidly evaporate.  

The more threatened those on this inside feel, the less they invoke principles &amp; philosophy. They revert to their instinctive zero-sum thinking -- every advance for the Other is a loss for them. Efforts to exclude &amp; punish Others become more raw, naked, &amp; cruel.  

We're seeing this play out. Principle &amp; policy have all but vanished on the right. (The GOP *has no party platform*.) It has become a cult of power, united behind a strongman, fighting rabidly to prevent the cultural &amp; economic advance of Others. It's all out in the open now.  

The notion that something else displaced conservatism is too flattering to conservatism. What we're seeing now is the raw impulses that are *always at the core of conservatism*, in all times &amp; places. This is just what they look like when they are longer confidently on top.  

The reason I'm constantly beating this drum is that some people have been warning about exactly this trajectory for decades now. But mainstream Dems, centrist, pundits, &amp; other VSPs have run interference for conservatism, helped give it a veneer of philosophical legitimacy.  

For years &amp; years, WAY too long, they dismissed the raw impulses of conservatism as the ""fringe,"" as though the stuffy, tie-wearing, faux-philosophical, DC-think-tank version were the real thing. They ignored the warning signs &amp; dismissed those who didn't as partisan alarmists.  

But now the trajectory is reaching its inevitable conclusion: raw ethnonationalism, violence, &amp; authoritarianism. It is crucial that everyone understands, this is not a break from conservatism. This IS conservatism when the status quo is threatened. This was always it.",AskALiberal,1607807552

&gt;President-elect Joe Biden expressed skepticism about his powers to implement his agenda by executive action Tuesday in a private virtual meeting with civil rights leaders, according to a recording reported Thursday by The Intercept.

&gt;Biden told a group of seven leaders of civil rights organizations that some progressive Democrats are urging executive actions that are ""way beyond the bounds"" of a president's legal authority. The comments reflect what Biden has said publicly about the limited scope of executive action and the need for presidents to work with Congress to enact long-lasting policy.
In the meeting, Biden said he planned to roll back everything President Donald Trump has done through executive action, rather than with the approval of Congress. He said he would use his powers ""to undo every single damn thing this guy has done by executive authority.""

&gt;""I am not going to violate the Constitution. Executive authority that my progressive friends talk about is way beyond the bounds,"" he said.

&gt;But, he said, he would not seek to use executive action to mandate policy changes that he has long said are up to Congress to make.

&gt;Biden cited gun control as an example, saying that if he signed an executive order banning assault weapons, a future Republican president could undo that ban and use it as a precedent to drastically expand gun rights.

&gt;""I also don't think we should get too far ahead ourselves on dealing with police reform in that, because they've already labeled us as being 'defund the police' anything we put forward in terms of the organizational structure to change policing -- which I promise you, will occur. Promise you,"" Biden said.

&gt;""That's how they beat the living hell out of us across the country, saying that we're talking about defunding the police. We're not. We're talking about holding them accountable. We're talking about giving them money to do the right things. We're talking about putting more psychologists and psychiatrists on the telephones when the 911 calls through. We're talking about spending money to enable them to do their jobs better, not with more force, with less force and more understanding.""

* Senior congressional staffers tend to mischaracterize the policy preferences of their districts/states, compared to polling data

* This error tends to be directional (both Democrats and Republicans over-estimate the conservatism of their constituencies in general)

* Staffers whose members are up for competitive re-election, who theoretically should be paying more attention to what their voters actually want, do no better than other staffers

* Staffers tend to evaluate constituent opinions as closer to the staffer's individual opinion than they actually are

* Staffers who have served for longer are no better at this than newer staffers

* Consistent contact with interest groups and campaign contributions can push staffers' misperceptions of constituent opinion in the direction of those interest groups and contributors",AskALiberal,1607626541

* The gender pay gap remains stagnant. In the US for instance, men earned $66,000 on average pre-tax in 2017 compared to women making $45,000. In 2020, it's $72,000 to $51,000. The pay gap is larger in other first world countries and of course much larger in second and third world territories, and it's expected to RISE rather than decrease in the future due to the effects of the pandemic.
* Violence against women is at it's highest rates in decades, in the US, Europe and elsewhere around the world. Femicides in particular are surging at levels rarely seen before. Some of the sources on the growing violence can be seen here [https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/mind-games/201909/the-number-women-murdered-partner-is-rising](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/mind-games/201909/the-number-women-murdered-partner-is-rising), here [https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/04/us/domestic-violence-international.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/04/us/domestic-violence-international.html) and here [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-latam-violence-trf/rising-violence-against-women-in-latin-america-confirms-fears-of-abuses-in-lockdowns-idUSKBN23G2X6](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-latam-violence-trf/rising-violence-against-women-in-latin-america-confirms-fears-of-abuses-in-lockdowns-idUSKBN23G2X6).

* Women continue to struggle to break into high-paying male dominated fields, comprising a majority in low paying professions like nursing, teaching and healthcare while struggling to climb above 10-15% of money making jobs in engineering, finance, law or as doctors etc. An example of this can be seen in a gender breakdown of doctors by speciality [https://thedo.osteopathic.org/2018/10/men-outnumber-women-3-to-1-in-some-specialties-in-the-u-k/](https://thedo.osteopathic.org/2018/10/men-outnumber-women-3-to-1-in-some-specialties-in-the-u-k/).

* Their stated goal of 'defunding' police departments has collapsed, with the idea not coming close to getting a majority of Americans behind it in polling [https://www.newsweek.com/81-black-americans-dont-want-less-police-presence-despite-protestssome-want-more-cops-poll-1523093](https://www.newsweek.com/81-black-americans-dont-want-less-police-presence-despite-protestssome-want-more-cops-poll-1523093) and virtually nobody doing it. The 3-4 counties that actually cut their police budgets and redirected them to other services ended up making up the costs by closing down things like their Sexual Assault and Animal Cruelty Units [https://www.foxnews.com/politics/la-police-budget-cuts-sexual-assault-unit](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/la-police-budget-cuts-sexual-assault-unit) which has soured a lot of citizens there on the idea.
* The number of fatal police shootings among black americans remains stagnant. Despite all of the protests in 2020 and in years prior, the numbers are unchanged from 2015 levels [https://www.pennmedicine.org/news/news-releases/2020/october/fatal-police-shootings-among-black-americans-remain-high-unchanged-since-2015](https://www.pennmedicine.org/news/news-releases/2020/october/fatal-police-shootings-among-black-americans-remain-high-unchanged-since-2015).
* The white-black ecomonic/wealth divide is as big today as it was in the 1960s [https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/25/opinion/sunday/race-wage-gap.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/25/opinion/sunday/race-wage-gap.html)
* The average black family's net worth has been falling rather than rising in recent years, with it standing at just $17,600 at the start of the pandemic and expected to fall to closer to $10,000 now. For comparison, the average white family's net worth was $171,000 at the start of the pandemic and is expected to RISE to closer to $185,000 going forward.
* Black people have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19, with them being 13.4% of the US population yet accounting for 18.7% of casualties from the virus [https://www.statista.com/statistics/1122369/covid-deaths-distribution-by-race-us/](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1122369/covid-deaths-distribution-by-race-us/). This means that more than 53,360 black people have died from Covid which equates to around 1 out of every 768 black americans overall. It is by far the worst ratio out of any major ethnic group.
* 50% of black-owned small businesses have permanently shut down throughout the pandemic [https://www.forbes.com/sites/pedrodacosta/2020/08/10/the-covid-19-crisis-has-wiped-out-nearly-half-of-black-small-businesses/?sh=6ff224664310](https://www.forbes.com/sites/pedrodacosta/2020/08/10/the-covid-19-crisis-has-wiped-out-nearly-half-of-black-small-businesses/?sh=6ff224664310).

* LGBTs still make up less than 1% of all business owners and have less than 1% representation on average in government.
* Their ability to be represented more in entertainment media has recently taken a big hit with several major movie markets such as China and Russia banning or heavily restricting LGBT content and characters from screenings, thus meaning Western movies will either have to cut all such content from their own productions or make them inconsequential so they can be easily edited out for release in those countries.
* You can still heavily discriminate against LGBT individuals in the workplace, with employers being able to fire someone for their sexual orientation or gender identity in businesses of 15 workers or less [https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/even-ruling-workplace-still-unequal-lgbtq-workers-n1231419](https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/even-ruling-workplace-still-unequal-lgbtq-workers-n1231419). Transgender individuals are still often not allowed to use the bathrooms of their non-assigned birth gender, there are still roads to fire LGBTs from their jobs for religious reasons and medical care is often heavily reduced for LGBTs [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-16/lgbtq-workers-still-face-on-job-bias-risk-from-small-businesses](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-16/lgbtq-workers-still-face-on-job-bias-risk-from-small-businesses).

""Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.""

One issue is that many of those who are opposed to certain aspects of freedom of religion are often non religious themselves. It's not a secret that Republicans and the right in the USA tend to be more religious than Democrats and the left. According to Pew Research Center, as of 2016, agnostics and athiests tend to be Democrats by at least a 43% margin. A Republican would never even think about suggesting religious organizations be ripped of their tax exempt status in a primary yet Beto O'Rourke suggested just that this year and he has still been connected with Biden as his ""gun czar"".

https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/02/23/u-s-religious-groups-and-their-political-leanings/

As someone who has been religious my whole life, the 1st ammendment is the most important issue in my political views. Heck, I am extremely pro gun and even that takes a backseat to religious freedom, freedom of speech etc.

I think a perfect thing to talk about is the 2002 Supreme Court case involving Jehovahs Witnesses refusing to register with a local town to proselyte, making their activities a misdemeanor. The Supreme Court ruled in favor of the Jehovah's Witnesses granting them the right to proselyte without a permit.

I share a personal story in the hopes that you all will believe it or at least try to believe it if you don't initially.

The emotional and mental state of my family is currently at the worst I have ever seen it in my lifetime, and I bet at least part of it is because of the lockdowns. One of my 2 sisters still at home has been difficult to deal with usually, but its even worse this year. She has been increasingly manipulative of my other sister, more selfish and rude. She often refuses to go out because she is afraid that someone will see her and judge her, not because she isn't being covid conscious, which she is, but because of how she looks. She has become increasingly depressed and suicidal when I had never would have thought she was suicidal to begin with. She used to be so social and loved it and now she isn't, and it is taking a toll on her. Its gotten to the point where my parents have talked about doing family therapy when I have never heard them talk about it before in my 23 years of life.

And the kicker is that while my family is in the liberal state of Washington, which has had more restrictive lockdowns than most other states, my 50 year old dad contracted COVID, and he has been working from home for almost a decade before COVID.

For background, President Obama hated earmarks (read: pork barrel spending) and vowed to veto any bill that included them. The House in 2009 effectively banned them but is now considering being them back because of the conclusion of a bipartisan 2018 Select Committee looking to reform the gridlock in Congress. 

IMO, this is a less incendiary way forward than blowing up the filibuster (which I’m not sure the Senate will vote for) and it has the benefit of making Reps and Senators less dependent on the party national committees. It’s a carrot for the Congresspeople that are willing to work with both sides.

Anyways here's the excerpt I'm trying to understand:

 Most empirical studies indicate long-term benefits for natives’ employment and wages from immigration, although some studies suggest that these gains come at the cost of short-term losses from lower wages and higher unemployment. Standard economic theory implies that while higher labor supply from immigration may initially depress wages, over time firms increase investment to restore the amount of capital per worker, which then restores wages. Steady growth in the capital-labor ratio prevents workers’ average productivity, and therefore their average wages from declining over the long run. Figure 2 shows the pre-1980 trend in the capital-labor ratio extrapolated over the next few decades – the period when U.S. immigration accelerated. Consistent with the theory, the actual capital-labor ratio did not significantly or permanently deviate from that trend after 1980.

===================================

My understanding:

 Capital here means like machines and stuff right? So if you hire a bunch of new workers (because there are more people in the market, so naturally demand is higher, meaning you need more workers), these workers only have a limited number of machines to work on, so to maximize output/profit, a firm must invest in more machines, which creates demand for machines, growing other businesses, and this reinvests in the local economy.

I've noticed that so many on the Right are so skeptical about things like vaccines and mask mandates, despite a plethora of evidence indicating that they are extremely safe and effective.

A majority of this stuff could easily be fact checked and dismissed in less than 5 minutes.

&gt; “Trump was on the verge of revealing [aliens existence], but the aliens in the Galactic Federation are saying, ‘Wait, let people calm down first,'” Eshed, who helmed Israel’s space security program from 1981 to 2010, reportedly said. “They don’t want to start mass hysteria.

So far, video and photo evidence of abhorrent behavior has proven to be the downfall of Democratic politicians but not Republican politicians-but at least for now it’s been restricted to crimes like sexual assault (Al Franken for example, vs Trump). Politicians have also been fortunate enough to not have been surrounded by cameras in their youth-something tells me Brett Kavanaugh would’ve not been confirmed had there been people with cell phones at all his parties and ragers.

Now, those are all examples of sexual assault, so it’s pretty cut and dry. No one would or should forgive a 17 year old for sexual assault.

Something that, if he said as an adult on video, would be worth him getting canned. Would the party look past it?

39,Donald Trump and the stab in the back theory.,"They say history doesn't repeat itself but it rhymes. For those unfamiliar with the stab in the back theory. It comes from the germans after world war one. The United states was closing in on Germany and theyre supplies and territories were dwindling. It looked like they were going to lose so the German army surrendered and signed the armistice treaty. But. Their were a large amount of Germans who believed they were not losing the war and that they were being tricked into surrendering by the Jews, socialist and members of their own Republican party. Basically betrayed by their own country men who were not real germans. 
This theory became propaganda for far right and nationalist groups during the weimar republic. It was one of the reasons Hitler came to power and that a dictatorship formed. 

Fast forward to today. Trump fairly and squarely lost the election. But this myth that Trump didn't lose, but it was the liberals, Jews, immigrants and socialists over throwing Trump and forcing him out of office basically stabbing the ""real"" Americans in the back is definitely being thrown around.

This was the largest number of American civil casualties in a single non-natural event prior to 9/11. The group was 70% black, and 30% were children. It’s considered a mass murder-suicide, as many of the victims did not willingly commit suicide and were either forcibly injected or killed by gunshot.

I'm curious what liberals think of this line of thought.

POST:

Hello!

It is commonly stated that liberals are out of touch with working class voters and are elitist. If this is the case, why do you vote for Republicans? From all accounts Republicans offer policies that directly benefit the individuals like myself. I am a white, young, male with a trade job in tech that lives in a liberal city and while I advocate for oftentimes far left policies, I directly benefit from Republican legislation. I grew up in rural/military parts of this country and served myself. Most of my conservative family and friends struggle day to day and do not see how they are voting against their own economic interests. The unions are extremely weakened or non-existent, they are up to their eyeballs in medical debt or mortgages, and corporations have no incentives in bringing jobs to their communities. Meanwhile, my investments have soared, my income has tripled, money is flooding into my neighborhood and city.

I agree that liberals complain far too much about trivial issues often associated with identity politics, if we are as selfish as claimed I do not understand why liberals shouldn't be worshipping Trump! Thanks to the tax cuts pushed by the Republican Senate and President Trump I have the resources to go to college debt free. The COVID-19 relief packages are allowing my employer to pay me a bonus this Christmas. The short term (and some long term) gains achieved by Republicans have made my life much MUCH better.

The Republicans and Conservatives in my life attribute my success to my own personal work ethic and while I appreciate their recognition...I don't work as hard as they do. I don't raise cattle, I've long since been out of the military, and I certainly don't have a family that is reliant on not just my financial support but my my time and focus.

So why are my friends and family having to continuously fight against an economy that gets worse for them every single year meanwhile a fairly ardent and considerably lazy leftist such as myself succeeds?

I am NOT making a case that Democrats are going to serve you better. I do not represent the average American but for the last 4 years liberals and leftists like me have only benefitted from Republicans financially whereas Republican voters have struggled. Why is that?

EDIT: I wrote this to come off as self important and smug. To play ""devil's advocate"" I want to represent myself as a caricature. I am also aware that I am not reflective of your average liberal voter. I am an extremely fortunate and grateful man whose heart breaks for the friends and family I have in rural America and the military. I also respect the vast majority of you as well.",AskALiberal,1607293717

Interestingly, men were found to be more likely to take the vaccine:

Look at the history:

Unfettered free markets produced a patrimonial capitalism (much like we are returning to today by many measures - [America’s 1% hasn’t had this much wealth since just before the Great Depression](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/its-been-almost-a-100-years-since-the-americas-1-had-so-much-wealth-2019-02-11)) which gave rise to the gilded age. Non-coincidentally, Karl Marx wrote a book that sung to the hearts of many overworked and exploited workers and radicalized many. We all know how this ended. For one, Europe become hyper-nationalistic, blaming neighbors for their woes. Populism was on the rise. This led to WW1. Here is a look at the historical parallels by the way:

[The first Gilded Age saw massive wealth inequalities, hyperpartisanship, virulent anti-immigrant sentiment and growing concern about money in politics. Sound familiar?](https://www.history.com/news/second-gilded-age-income-inequality)

Fast forward, the failure of governments to regulate the banking sector led to the Great Depression (which we unregulated in 1999 with Glass-Steagall passed in the depression era. crazy enough 8 years later we had another meltdown, but dampened by more government involvement in the economy - Friedmanites can’t tell me 8 years later it’s a coincidence).

The failure of the governments to then properly respond led to a massive rise in poverty. The situation was already bad in Germany from WW1, so the population was easily radicalized. You can basically link the rise of fascism to the rise in poverty caused by “liberalism.” And everyone knows the rest of this story.

Someone brought up the Reagan quote to me, I immediately agreed with him. He ended up mindlessly agreeing with my assessment - not even realizing Reagan was part of the coalition to put us closer to the right wing policy back then. Oh the irony.",AskALiberal,1607178561

During the height of power for the Black Panthers they would engage in ""cop watching"" where they observed policemen in their duties while carrying loaded guns. The California legislature didn't take kindly to that and preceded to prepare a vote on a bill banning the carrying of loaded firearms in public by civilians. The Black Panthers decided to protest the bill by entering the California legislature building in Sacramento armed to the teeth. This did not deter the legislature (which was controlled by Democrats) from passing the bill, which was then signed into law by Governor Ronald Reagan.

And thus, an attempt to curb police brutality in their own community by concerned African-Americans was thwarted by both Democrats and Republicans (the Mulford Act was introduced by a Republican and cosponsored by both Republicans and Democrats).

November 20: Georgia certifies it’s election results 

Nov 22: Trump demands the governor perform a recount. Doesn’t get it because Governor doesn’t have that authority

Nov 25: Sidney Powell comes out with her election fraud lawsuit 

Dec 2: Gabriel Sterling makes his speech demanding Trump stop inciting violence

Dec 4: Michelle Malkin and Dan Crenshaw openly feud on twitter. Pretty brazen insults thrown towards a veteran

The obvious example of a populist candidate would be Donald Trump. These candidates are characterized by little to no cooperation with the other side, forgoing certain capatilistic principles if it is in the name of populism (tariffs come to mind), being against foreign military engagement (at least on rhetoric), and being more reactionary on social issues.

I was considering voting for Jo Jorgenson as a sort of protest vote (I don't like Trump's handling of COVID, among other things), but as I'm in a swing state, I felt that it would basically be throwing away my vote and help Biden. I was also considering posting this on /r/cmv, but figured this would be a better place to ask. I've read through [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskALiberal/comments/k5a4hl/how_far_left_has_the_democratic_party_actually/) thread, but still have remaining questions.

In my opinion, I believe that [The Squad](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Squad_\(United_States_Congress\)) are holding young voters hostage, and forcing the Democrats to lean more and more left.

For some background, I've read through AOC's policies, disagreeing with some and agreeing with some. I feel the GND would be way too expensive (costing about $93 trillion dollars, [source](https://www.investopedia.com/the-green-new-deal-explained-4588463#bidens-clean-energy-revolution)). However, I do agree that work does need to be done in order to combat global warming. I also agree with her and Democrats as a whole that healthcare needs adjusting, however just not to the extent that they call for.

Regardless, and to further expand on my original point, I believe policies such as free college are just to appease young voters. When Bernie was making his first run in 2016 and talked about having free college, as someone who just graduated high school, I thought ""hell yeah!"". But now as I advance in age (that's a strange way to put it), I understand this as a ploy to get more and more young voters. Her streams on Twitch, which attracted hundreds of thousands of viewers, further exemplifies this point -- she'll do anything she could possibly do in order to get more and more young voters. She's always using social media to drive her points, which is very much skewed to young folks ([source](https://sproutsocial.com/insights/new-social-media-demographics/#TW-demos)).

Typically, young voters tend to skew Democrat (as mentioned above) because Democrats typically, in my mind, offer us the moon and the stars. Trump is also guilty of this, of course, but her way of doing this to mass effect is holding young voters hostage. 

Let's offer a crazy hypothetical: AOC is the Democratic candidate in 2024. Part of her policy is that she'll pass legislation that everyone gets a million dollars on their birthday. The Democrats say no, that's crazy, it'll cost waaaaaay too much. AOC responds, ""guys, I have literally every young voter in my pocket. If you don't add this, I'm gonna switch my ticket to the Cool People Party, a la Teddy Roosevelt."" 

This is personally how I feel the party will progress, which will alienate more moderates (like me) and force us to vote Republican or third party.

Like I said at the top, I'm completely open to my mind being changed. I've had tons and tons of great conversations on /r/AskTrumpSupporters and hoping this will be a continuation of that. Thanks.",AskALiberal,1606968261

20,What do you think of attempts to democratize an economy like those proposed by Sanders and Corbyn?,"In particular I'm talking about seizing equity on behalf of workers and giving it to worker managed funds (i.e. members of those funds are elected by workers). I see some potential upsides and downsides and am working out where i sit. 

&amp;#x200B;

Upsides:

\- Gives workers far more control over their companies which could boost wages, lead to less job loss, prevents excessive exploitation, etc.

\- Provide great stability for working families.

&amp;#x200B;

Downsides

\- Could lead to economic inefficiency. Workers are replaced because there are cheaper options, workers are always a company's last resort. If they owned a company and could use their power to keep themselves on board, that could lead to higher costs. This problem would be lesser in a more competitive market though.

\- You don't get to the top of these worker managed firms by focusing on economic profits, you get there by winning votes from workers. To do that, you have to make promises and run elections. Effectively it generates more internal politics in a company which can interfere with its profit incentives. They could promise higher pay when the company doesn't really need to offer it, that sorta thing. This would increase costs and decrease profits, scaring off investors. Of course, this could be something of a self-regulating mechanism though.

\- Could scare off entrepreneurs because they don't want to lose control over the company.

\- Dilutes investors stakes in the company which could scare them off.

\- It could be easier to dole out contracts to political allies instead of the cheapest/best firm, making things more costly and inefficient. Buying from local companies looks good when running for election from workers living in an area, but it could be more expensive and hurt profit incentives.

\- Ultimately, there's no guarantee that power would actually go to employees. The elected members of these firms could easily become corrupt and work to maintain their status more than bettering the lot of workers. This already happens in democracies today, many people here in the US feel that the elite have left them behind. The same thing could happen on a smaller scale in companies. You just wouldn't have to have competitive elections. If you are able to manipulate pay you could try and do that to keep rivals down, or you could mandate anti-rival ads or whatever in your company. There's a lot of ways a democracy can be corrupted. Sure, the government could intervene to prevent this sorta stuff, but what extent will that take?

A better solution may just be strong unions that rely on collective bargaining power to negotiate with employers. I understand that many of my concerns here don't occur in germany with their corporate board election system. That differs from the equity thing so it doesn't cause nearly the same concern for investors, but the last, second, and first points may still ring true. What do you think?

23,What do you think of the idea of co-determination?,"Hello,

&amp;#x200B;

Once I graduate I would like to become an entrepreneur in the computer science industry. I want to maintain control over any company I start because I was the one who put in the risk and who would eventually put up capital. However, I am also a social democrat and believe in a strong welfare state and am sympathetic to the labour movement (i.e. workers should have some say in how their lives are run). The solution to me seems to be one of three things:

1) Strong labour unions (not sure what policies would help the unions as i'm not super versed in union legislation).

2) Mandatory co-determination like in germany (workers get a say on company boards. This policy is better than seizing equity because it minimizes complications, prevents owners from losing control of their company in a big way (if owners lost control, fewer people would start companies because they don't want to lose that control. Fewer companies = less competition = bad for consumers and workers), makes it harder to sell a company, and prevents employers from having to give more finacial details than they are comfortable with. The equity option is intriguing because it offers employess far more direct control over the company and entitles them to some of its profits, but I am concerned that fewer businesses would get started that way. I asked about this in a different post about Bernie and some people said it was an amazingly bad deal for stockholders and there may end up being a capital flight. I don't understand why that would be the case, if you know please tell me!)

3) A mixture of co-determination and unions. Herein a company would have the choice in either electing a certain % of their board from workers, or they would have to allow workers to unionize. There must be some form of a collective labor voice in any moderately large firm. To me, this seems the best option because it allows companies and workers to pick what best works for them whilst also allowing for a company to potentially retain control over the board but being unable to screw over workers.

His aid to Bashar Al-Assad has helped him kill thousands of syrian civilians. 

However since his rise to power, he has brought a lot of good things to russia. For example, the freedom surrounding religion have expanded, it is now easier to open a business and Russia has become arguably more capitalist and less communist, there is free internet, a noted decline in anti-semitism, and he seems to have a high approval rating across his own people. He seems to have been able to strengthen ties between russia and several other countries including china. 


I'm sure that very few of you actually support Putin because by American standards he is a pretty bad guy.

&gt;[The Arecibo Telescope was a 305 m (1,000 ft) spherical reflector dish built into a natural sinkhole at the Arecibo Observatory which was completed in November 1963. A cable-mount steerable receiver was mounted 150 m (492 ft) above the dish, and several radar transmitters for emitting signals. For more than 50 years, the Arecibo Telescope was the world's largest single-aperture telescope, surpassed in July 2016 by the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST) in China.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arecibo_Telescope)

&gt;[The Arecibo Telescope was primarily used for research in radio astronomy, atmospheric science, and radar astronomy, as well as for programs that search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI).](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arecibo_Telescope)

&gt;[Since 2006, the NSF has reduced its funding commitment to the observatory, leading academics to push for additional funding support to continue its programs. The telescope was damaged by Hurricane Maria in 2017 and was affected by earthquakes in 2019 and 2020. Two cable breaks, one in August 2020 and a second in November 2020, threatened the structural integrity of the support structure for the suspended platform and damaged the dish. Due to uncertainty over the remaining strength of the other cables supporting the suspended structure, and the risk of collapse owing to further failures making repairs dangerous, the NSF announced on November 19, 2020, that it would decommission and dismantle the telescope, with the radio telescope and LIDAR facility remaining operational. Before it could be decommissioned, several of the remaining support cables failed, sending the entire receiver and its supported structure collapsing into the dish on December 1, 2020.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arecibo_Telescope)

NPR:

&gt;[In Arecibo's nearly 60 years of operation, the observatory's powerful capabilities made it a popular choice for researchers chasing breakthroughs in radio astronomy and atmospheric science.

These statements are heavily oversimplified because I don't want to write an essay over a 30 minute conversation. But it made me think, I was always taught it was a classic good vs evil war, but history is more black and white than that a lot of times. What do you all think?",AskALiberal,1606789786

73,Should Neera Tanden be disqualified from being a government official given that she has previously physically attacked a journalist?,"Biden has recently announced Neera Tanden as his pick for head of the Budget Office.

Should the fact that Tanden was violent towards a journalist who simply called out her then boss on her foreign policy record render her unfit to hold a White House position?

74,What should/can be done about the incoming massive homelessness crisis?,"As you know, *many* Americans have been evicted from their homes due to the lack of stimulus funds, leaving thousands unable to pay rent. However, it turns out that the “thousands” is actually a massive understatement.  

Estimates say that [**upwards of 19 million Americans are in danger of facing eviction early next year.**](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/eviction-19-million-americans-risk-moratorium-coronavirus/)

&gt; Millions of Americans are in danger of losing their homes when federal and local limits on evictions expire at the end of the year, a growing body of research shows.

&gt;A report issued this month from the National Low Income Housing Coalition (NLIHC) and the University of Arizona estimates that 6.7 million households could be evicted in the coming months. That amounts to 19 million people potentially losing their homes, **rivaling the dislocation that foreclosures caused after the subprime housing bust.**

That's more than one of every 20 people. 

&gt;The situation could reach crisis levels in the new year. With Congress yet to pass another coronavirus relief package, about 12 million Americans are set to lose their unemployment benefits the day after Christmas, a sharp fall in income that would make it harder for many people to pay rent. An abrupt cutoff would slash income by about $19 billion per month, Nancy Vanden Houten, lead economist at Oxford Economics, said in a research note.


If we expand the definition,around 18.9 million adults (not counting kids) are living in households that are presently behind on rent or mortgage. In addition, up to 50 million Americans are now facing extreme food insecurity that's one in every 6 people.


This has the potential to be far, far worse than the 2008 housing-bubble burst. Aside from the obvious, I am extremely concerned about this for a variety of reasons: 


1. A rise in crime: Millions of people with no other means of sustaining themselves are going to turn to crime/be victimized by crime in order to put food on the table.

2. An increase in political violence: There’s going to be a lot of desperate people with nothing else to lose in this country if estimates are true. This is a massive potential powder keg. Some are going to start aiming bullets at those that they believe are the cause of their suffering. 

3. Biden, The Economy, and 2024: The incumbent President’s performance in the elections is always tied to how well the economy was during their term, regardless of their ability to control it. Indeed, it could be argued that the *only* reason Trump lost was because of the economic slowdown from COVID-19. As such it stands to reason that Biden and The Democrats will be massively effect by this in the midterms and beyond. Depending on the severity of this homelessness crisis, you may even see “Bidenvills” turn up in Republican messaging *ala* Hoovervilles.   


20 million people without homes just isn’t sustainable for the health of this country. Additionally, this may cause Coronavirus cases to rise even further, with more people outside of quarantine and on the streets.

If more right-wing judges had been appointed federally and state-wide to the judiciary could that have led to an overturning?  Would a competent legal team have made a difference?

Furthermore, was there ever any legitimate belief in the Trump administration that the result could be changed?

**Conservative:**  Promote current and historical traditions and values of society.  Promote no changes except slowly and cautiously.

**Conservative Democrat:**  Promote a free market without excess government interference, and also use government to promote social and economic equality.

**Conservative Republican:**  Make changes/laws slowly and cautiously.  Promote society's traditional values and traditions, even or especially if this is undoing recent changes. Reduce abortion access, government restrictions, laws, and taxes.

**Democrat:** Promote social and economic equality, use government to regulate economy, support gun regulation, labor unions, college assistance, health care, consumer protection, and environmental protection.

**Libertarian Socialist:** Government should be greatly limited.  Ownership of means of production should be in hands of those working.  Capitalism is harmful.

**Market Socialist:**  Society as a whole should own and cooperate in managing the means of production, but the market economy should otherwise be utilized for distribution of product and management of profit.

**Social Democrat:**  We should retain the capitalist framework but pursue the values of socialism, as Scandinavia's doing, using taxation and government-funded programs to ensure the well-being of the people.

**Socialist:**  Ownership of means of production should be in hands of those working, and profits should go to those workers and not to some outside owner/manager.

**Tea Party:**  Conservative and libertarian.  Government should tax less and spend less, reduce the debt, stick firmly to the literal meaning of the Constitution.

**Trump Supporter:**  Those in financial, social, or legal power belong there; social change to help the marginalized or outsiders is counterproductive.  America has gotten too soft and kind; we should return to what we imagine earlier era's behavior and legal power structures to have been.

**Warren Democrat:**  Elizabeth Warren's political foci include student loan forgiveness, consumer protections, addressing climate change, stricter regulations for banking, universal child care, health care, taxing the megarich, and reduction of political influence of corporations.

But anyways, is Trump really a fascist? I don't think he is, he isn't an extreme auth nor is his brand of nationalism extreme. Augusto Pinochet is regarded as not fascist by academics, even though he did a lot of fucked up shit and was way more auth than Trump.

I get it's not the best source, but I didn't know where to start researching this, and on her wikipedia page it says ""Prosecutions for low-level marijuana offenses were rare under Harris, and her office had a policy of not pursuing jail time for marijuana possession offenses.""

So are there weed smokers she was prosecuting? Is this just a lie, if so where's the disconnect coming from?

Other things she's done that I saw criticism for is that pursuing truancy cases is racist because the people truant are predominantly black families, but she wasn't throwing black parents in jail, she came a lot of leeway. She only pursued it because the kids dying in homicides only were there because they weren't at school. That seems like it's helping the black community?

&amp;#x200B;

So I have been trying to understand income inequality in the United States and consistently see trickle down policies blamed and many people (including the IMF) says it doesn't work. I understand the data indicates that this is so (as far as I'm aware), but I just want to understand from a theoretical point of view why that is.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So basically, and please correct me if I'm wrong, trickle down basically says that specific tax cuts like income taxes and such will lead to the rich having more money to spend. They will then go on to invest this in business because they want to become even more wealthy and they hope that by investing they become so, they can save it and spend it later, etc. But it seems that that hasn't happened, which is weird because as I understand it the rich don't have like all their money sitting in a bank account but it's spread over many assets and investments.

My current understanding of why this is is as follows (again please correct me if I'm wrong):

Basically, if you're rich, you can buy up a lot of stocks, and with those stocks you can vote for a company to buy them back and you get a big fat profit from that, hence the high rate of stock buy backs instead of that money going towards something useful like hiring new employees or investing in new technology. Alternatively, you can store that in a variety of stocks on wall street and just get safe investments, not actually investing in anything new or risky. Plus the rich spend a smaller portion of their income by their nature because they can afford to save more.

It was about a woman who miscarried after being kicked in the stomach and whether the miscarriage should be considered murder. 

I’ve heard the whole piano player needing your body to survive thought experiment. Frankly I don’t think it’s a useful metaphor, if you apply the concept to a baby that you gave birth to it doesn’t work. 

If you gave birth but couldn’t afford formula (really not that far-fetched of a scenario) then would you have the right to not breastfeed? The answer to that imo is yes, but you have a duty to put the baby in a place where it can be fed/taken care of. If that’s not possible then you should be obligated to breastfeed because you’re the reason that the child exists, unlike the piano player.

Therefore, I believe that the only solid argument in favor of abortion is that the fetus is not a person until it could live outside of the womb with medical assistance.

I don't have a doubt in my mind that these people wouldn't try and make the program so it benefits mainly white people in a manner similar to how military benefits went mainly to white veterans. And make as many barriers for PoCs (particularly black individuals) from obtaining it or having weird systematic processes that diminishing the program for PoCs. An example I made up, is they make people go to physical places to apply and make them only in white neighborhoods. Since a lot of individuals with student debt move back with their parents this would affect PoCs and make it harder for them to receive the benefit.

And I don't think people will care until years later when we realize just the impact of it. Once again back to the example we now care about how black veterans were given houses in worse areas impacts future generations. But no one seemed to care back in the day because they still got houses. And will never do anything to correct.

I genuinely believe that what would actually happen is that IF student debt is cancelled it would be used to further the wealth divide between PoCs and white people. Do people really not see this as an issue that will likely happen in the world we live in?",AskALiberal,1606415533

79,Why do Liberals want Universal Health care?,"Background, This week a friend and I were discussing typical liberal talking points like systemic racism and how to go about fixing it.  The topic of universal health care came up and he said that simply having it would prevent healthcare bills from ruining lives if say your child has a major health incident or you, as a young adult, have a major health incident and are stuck with bills that are astronomical. There are several questions here. Why do liberals want universal healthcare?

 In European countries with UH has it really helped the population? the reason for this question is that I have been to EU and, from my perspective, the standard of living (Spain, England, for instance) is pretty low compared to the US. Small expensive apartments, higher prices for goods, gas...etc. While traveling in the EU I remember thinking to myself ""why is everyone so poor?"" I mean I don't know anything about their income/savings ...etc. but it was just an observation looking from the outside.

Also what is the percentage of individuals that have been relieved of high health care bills? Most young people are healthy until they get into their 30s and more financially secure and afford healthcare? So what is the percentage of individuals that would benefit ""substantially"" from UH?

One argument he put forth was that UH would help minorities in the US because now they wouldn't have to choose between healthcare and food on the table? Is this the main argument? We have medicaid already to help the poor so what would be the difference here? With UH the poor would get relief and because of this wouldn't be relegated to remaining poor (eventually).

84,(Very very very long post from a liberal leftist type) How do I deal with all this?,"Hi there, my name is Andre. Before we start, I want to give you some background on me so maybe you understand me better. Yes, it will be long. Sorry. 

I turned 20 years old recently. I’ve been depressed for over 7-8 years. Depression is all I know (with OCD tendencies) along with hard social anxiety. I’m into art (I paint and draw) I enjoy video games, my choices for music include country rap, regular rap, metal rap, country, and a little sprinkle of heavy metal. I was born female. I’m gay, very masculine (gender questioning sometimes). I’m agnostic. So that’s kinda me. 

One think I’ve been into since 8th grade though? POLITICS! I’m not exactly sure what got me into it. At around this time in my life, I had no friends, and kids would occasionally bully me, say weird comments about me or not bother talking to me. I’m guessing that I got into politics in English class when we got into “debates” or did our little circles. I found it empowering to be able to counter some of these kids in this setting. It gave me a chance to argue with them. 

From that I discovered the world of politics, where arguing and debating was constant. I was always intrigued by the conversations the adults of my family would have at table during the Sunday dinner. So I started sitting near the adults to listen in on their conversations. I gradually started picking up on different words, what certain things meant etc. 

I also read some of my first political books when I was in 8th grade. I’m not exactly sure which one it was. It was either Black Hawk Down by Mark Bowden, some book about the rise of ISIS, or a book about Chris Kyle. One of those was the first. 

Gradually started reading more political books or war themed auto-biographies. Getting into high school years (sophomore year and on) I started watching more news. CNN documentaries, reading news articles or political youtube videos. 

My first political rally/march was in JUNE 2017. I was 16, still unsure about where I exactly I stood politically. I went to this thing called “March against sharia law”. I had a sign, that was supposed to be against sharia law or something. When we got there, it just looked like a bunch of Trump supporters coming together to hate on some random mosque. A bunch of Militia guys with guns showed up. I regret being on that side of the protest. I ended up on a breitbart article which freaked me out. 

I started becoming more leftist so to speak. Part of what pushed me that direction is me being gay. I used to be catholic (albeit barely) and when I realized I was gay I started questioning the Bible and from there I’m now agnostic. 

I was finding myself kind of turned off by the religious-rights mainly Christian rhetoric. The opposition to marriage equality, the opposition to transgender people, the constant mentions of god in speeches and by supporters. It kind of drove me away. 

I also started watching The Daily show when it was under Jon Stewart and I enjoyed it. It was my cup of tea so to speak. I had never seen political comedy type stuff and it immediately clicked. From there I eventually discovered Last Week Tonight by John Oliver(my favorite). I started watching more political documentaries and reading more articles. 

When Trump came around things really changed. After the past 4 years I’ve found myself a little further left. After all the things that happened the past 4 years, and listening to some family numbers excuse them or support them.... or bothered me. 

Politics was the only thing my depressed brain would let me consistently get interested in (still true to this day). I have trouble getting into my hobbies sometimes or deciding what I want to do, but I’m always down to watch John Oliver, a documentary on neo-nazis, or a political book. It’s strange. 

I started engaging with my father more, who I guess is a republican. I grew up listening to Mark Levin, Rush Limbaugh, Glen Beck. My dad has his opinions, but wasn’t to into the weeds about politics like I was. He was/is a relatively un-strict dad, not hyper-conservative like others. 

Within the last 2 years I found myself getting into more political conversations with him. We would watch the Democratic presidential debates together, along with the republican ones. We would watch John Oliver together. We definitely got into some very heated conversations, but usually got over them the next day. 

Well the last 2 years things ramped up and changed. I found my dad getting more hostile, and closing himself off to reading any articles I wanted to share. He stopped watching John Oliver with me. And it really bummed me out. Luckily the day before Election Day, I sent my dad a heartfelt message asking him to hear me out and sit down with me and watch some videos. He said yes, and for the first time in a long time he watched the videos he has avoided for quite some time. He ended up not voting for trump! I was happy I have have made a difference. 

I also started really picking up on some of my conservative families beliefs, and I started stressing over them. I at one point was confronted for my beliefs on religion by one of my uncles which caused me to have a massive panic attack. 

One of these uncles is a big catholic, private school type. And I hear him consistently say odd conservative things. He brought up out of no where how he doesn’t like Muslims. He cheered on the unmarked vans arresting people in Portland. He occasionally brings up how he watches Fox News. 

My other uncle, super-conservative also. My cousins are super liberal and have told me things about him. He says odd things. When the topic of COVID came up,he made a little comment saying that it was all noise to make trump look bad in the election. He also watches OAN and Fox News (as far as I know). Hell throw around words like “Marxist” , “socialist” and “communist” from time to time. I’ve heard him say weird stuff about transgender people. He was into confederate stuff. 

I remember one time the topic of Covid came up again, and this time I decided to counter him. He had gotten into this conversation with another one of my uncles (a Trump hating, liberal leaning independent). Well the OAN uncle started getting visibly upset. I had countered him about how our countries response to Covid could have been better. I brought up South Korea, and he said something along the lines of “well we should move there then!”. He also brought up how creepy the Joe Biden pictures were, but never brought up trumps creepiness. Well after that conversation he stopped coming over for dinner for weeks, and eventually came back. 

My aunt (his wife) also is conservative, all though when talking with me she was billed herself as “the person who listens to both sides”. She listens to Candace Owens. As far as I know she watches what my uncle watches. She once brought up to me how horrible socialism would be. So that’s her. 

Well, here I am now. I find myself getting really conflicted about these family members. I just don’t understand why they have to think the way they do. 

It’s like an internal struggle also. I’ve read so many books, so many articles, watched so many good John Oliver episodes, gone to so many political rallies. There’s all this information out there that I think is important, that I know they haven’t seen. And it stresses me out. 

I sometimes wish I could sit down with them for a couple hours and just show them some of the stuff I know they haven’t seen. It stresses me out so much. Like I don’t understand why they think the way they do sometimes. 

It hurts to know they think the way they do. It’s conflicting. My cousins understand exactly where I come from, as they themselves have told me about the heated arguments they’ve gotten into, they have told me about how they don’t bother bringing up politics at all out of fear. 

I’m working on speaking out more because after the last 4 years I’m kind of done being silent. And the way trump has acted around this election really disturbes me. It disturbes me to see the cult mentality among trump supporters and the right. Seeing the Q stuff. Seeing them leave Fox News just because Trump is mad at them. The OAN and newsmax. The people saying Trump hasn’t lost yet. It’s all scary to me. Im only 20 and it’s scary to see my country in this state. From my perspective, it’s scary to see the rabid, cult mentality, fascistic thinking of some of these right-wing Trump supporters. I can’t stand by and watch some of my own family fall too it. I cannot support the immoral, narcissistic Trump. So I’m slowly working on speaking out. 

It’s tough y’all, politics is a crazy thing now. Everything feels more extreme and polarized now. I struggle with political anxiety everyday. I’ll spend my nights asking myself “why does my uncle say this”. I’ll spend my hours formulating arguments in my head, like I’m actually talking to them in person. I’ve set up playlists of videos and notes with articles on the off chance that they wish to see my side of things. 

Honestly y’all at the end of the day, my life is crazy.

I believe the French were vital to our victory, heres why. 

The French rearguard at Dunkirk was vital to the success of the evacuation, without them nearly the entire British Expeditionary Force would have been killed or captured. 18,000 Frenchmen died and 35,000 were captured while covering the retreat of the British Expeditionary Forces and other French forces. After Dunkirk the French continued the fight, many of them being sent to Brittany. The French, despite being vastly outnumbered and outgunned, inflicted crushing causalities on the Germans, destroying nearly 50% of the Luftwaffe, killing 160,000 German soldiers, and destroying 1,800 German tanks. The French greatly weakened the Germans and gave the British time to prepare for the Battle of Britain. Because the French decimated the Luftwaffe in the Battle of France, the British were able to repel the weakened Luftwaffe and stay in the fight. Despite surrender, French forces continued to fight in Africa and gave the British and Americans access to Italian Libya. The French Resistance provided vital intel that was used to plan Operation Overlord and provided essential forces to the liberation of Aquitaine, Occitanie, and Paris. It's time the Frenchmen that saved the allies get the recognition they deserve

7,"Michael Morell, Biden, and the future of the CIA","Mike Morell is one of the top 3 people Biden is considering for CIA Director.

Pros- He has had a long career at the CIA. He has a reputation as a straight shooter. He is someone who would have deep support from within the building. 

Cons (that I think progressives will have)-

Even within the CIA, he is a big supporter of drone strikes. 

Also, he is a defender of the use of Enhanced Interrogation Techniques, though he never had a operational role in the program. 

From within the building he would be a patron of a controversial officer who used to run the Counterterrorism Center. This officer was once accused of being a “murderer” by a Senator.

Issues republicans may have- He was an early and outspoken critic of Donald Trump.

So this article has been making the rounds over at r/Conservative (Pinned there in fact) and r/Republican. I have yet to see it posted anywhere else on Reddit. I've also been seeing it pop up on a few Conservative News Sites as well (which I only really check to keep in the loop of what Conservatives are discussing).

Very curious for a Liberal response to the allegations made here. I'm a Liberal myself (as per my flair), and have no intention on discussing this article in Bad Faith. I merely wanted a Non-Conservative perspective (and I've not had the time to go through every bullet point myself).

At the end of the day, it comes down to the courts, and none of Trump's Lawsuits have gone through, I understand that. Biden is transitioning to the Presidency already. Still would like Liberal perspectives to the bullet points in this article.",AskALiberal,1606317450

I've recently started an Invisalign treatment and came to a specific dentist through my mom's boyfriend who's known the dentist for decades. I went there because she gave me a special price since she's known him for so long.Now, every time I've had an appointment I've overheard her talking to other patients or her assistants about politics. And it's not just politics, it's conspiracy theories.Hell, she's stated the belief that Covid is fake, the moon landing was faked and that soon we won't have any cash anymore in order to be disempowered... you know, the heavy type of conspiracy theories.She's never mentioned them to me personally, but every time I sit there just listening, I really don't know what to do. On one hand, I would really like to talk to her about this because this kind of thinking really is doing harm to our society. But on the other hand, she's about 60 years old, I don't think anyone could ever change her mind if she's already that deep into conspiracy theories.As some might ask, whether my mother's boyfriend knew: I've talked to him about it and he says that he hasn't been there for a few years and that she wasn't like this back then. He thinks she may have radicalized her ideas (Note: I live in Austria; there has been *heavy* radicalization going on in my country, or general Europe).

Also, I don't think I'm in the right place to discuss this with her. But isn't it also wrong (actually, illegal?) to talk politics with patients?

What would you do in my situation?I can't just switch dentists since the treatment is somehow linked to her specifically. It's fake Invisalign, she has a contract with a company (hence it's much cheaper). I've already paid the whole treatment.",AskALiberal,1606290958

I've been writing down my thoughts lately  on the political atmosphere over the last 12 years.. And here's my thoughts on the renewal of the patroit act..

So I remember when the Snowden leaks happenend in 2013, i saw those on the left AND the right were mad at Obama for the abuse from the intelligence community. The major consensus was ""this WILL be abused to spy and blackmail me or worse a political candidate"" and i know quite a few people who switched to the right because of it (myself included)

Fast foward to 2017-2018 and trump is rallying half the nation against the other over the Obama administration spying on the trump campaign.. Now I realize that china and russia are rising threats because of their interference of the 2016 election and we need those programs to stay ahead of them BUT

I think it would have shown humility if the democrats changed their position on goverment overreach to apeal to center republicans that they're in favor reducing the boogie man side of the federal government.. It would also keep those powers out of the hands of the next outsider radicals like trump to use on the democrats.. And if we want to combat Russian misinformation the democrats should focus on political education by appearing on podcasts and being more honest..

Including religious conservatism, [culture of honor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_of_honor_(Southern_United_States)) (Which is basically a combination of machismo, chivalry, and retributive justice), Southern hospitality, military tradition, agrarian ideals and American nationalism.

Wikipedia claims it reached an apogee in the 1990s, with a Democratic President and Vice President from the South and Congressional leaders in both parties being from the South. The source this point is based on from the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/11/us/politics/11south.html) says (in summary) that it's because of the phenomena we've seen in places like Virginia, North Carolina, and Georgia where people are moving there from other regions and making them more blue and less culturally homogenous.

It seems like a large chunk of the lefts supports “the plan to end animal farming by developing safe, cheap meat alternatives that taste as good and have the same nutritional benefits.”

I am really not okay with vegetarians insisting meat alternatives are good enough for everyone. They’re not. 

I am all for cutting back on meat consumption. And expanding awareness of slaughter practices (which should lead to more humane practices, as well as fewer meat eaters when people find out how the sausage is literally made!). But I am the type of person who would learn to slaughter my own chicken if that’s what it took to get a bucket of fried chicken once in a while.

Also: we can breed cattle to release a fraction of the greenhouse gases that we currently attribute to flatulent cows. But instead of promoting that type of innovation, environmentalism has become a pretext for animal rights activists to impose a vegetarian diet on everyone else.  There are other ways to save the planet besides making livestock illegal!

So yeah, I bring this up because 73+ million people just voted to re-elect Donald Drumpf. And I honestly wonder if far left ambitions like abolishing meat are part of the problem that makes the Democratic coalition vulnerable to losing future elections to GOP candidates who are even more dangerous than their current cult leader.

2a. Students earn more financial aid based on their performance in high school. If you can control your performance in high school, you can control your financial aid offered.

3. Free college will accelerate the national debt, which compromises income growth, increases interest payments on any type of loan or mortgage, and the future of the economy.

4. To balance the budget, faculty salaries and renovation and construction projects on campus will likely be cut, lowering the quality of education.

4. Taxes will increase for the middle class, maybe lower class, and those who chose not to go to college

&gt; Her four-year tenure at the helm of the Fed, marked by an improving jobs market and historically low interest rates, may also boost her odds for confirmation.
______

&gt; President Donald Trump in 2017 chose to replace Yellen with current Fed Chairman Jerome Powell at the expiration of her first term at the central bank. Gary Cohn, Trump's former National Economic Council director, offered congratulations to Yellen shortly after the news broke.
_____

&gt; Still, progressive Democrats may also welcome Yellen as Biden's Treasury pick thanks in part to her commitment on how economic policymakers could address climate change. She has in recent years voiced support for a carbon dioxide emissions tax.
_____

&gt; The Treasury secretary is the foremost navigator of the U.S. economy, managing the public debt and the execution of foreign penalties, monitoring the collection of taxes, and serving as the chief liaison between the administration and the financial markets and businesses large and small.
_____

&gt; Though Yellen would no longer play a part in the direction of the nation's monetary policy, a glance at her time at the Fed may suggest a cautious Treasury under her direction.

&gt; While leading the Fed, Yellen and other central bank officials raised the benchmark federal funds rate just five times over four years. By the time of her exit, the Fed had only just begun to shrink its massive, $4 trillion portfolio of bonds purchased during the Great Recession to stimulate the economy.

It was very clear she was going to be a part of this Administration before the election, and the second McConnell hinted at being obstructionist over Rice they dropped her.  My gut says that means Abrams is axed for the Administration, too, which is really a shame that two rising stars in the Democratic Party are frozen out simply because of GOP obstructionism before we even know if the GOP will be able to obstruct.

Even when you compare him to other bottom of the barrel Presidents like Johnson or Pierce, his lack of intelligence in basically any field make him worse than IMO since they were at least versed in politics, where as Trump seemingly doesn't know basically anything.

62,What productive response can Democrats take to the current Trump sabotage?,"Trump’s transition plans appear to be two-fold: (1) taking a giant shit on everything he touches between now and Biden’s inauguration, and (2) convincing his base that the presidency was stolen from them by the corrupt socialist democrats. 

It seems obvious to me that the objective of the first point is to create such a mess that they can cast Biden’s administration as incompetent spendthrifts in the next election cycle because it will be hard for voters to understand the amount of work required just to get our country back to where it needs to be. None of that work will be “sexy” for the left politically, and it will cost money to fix...while the right will magically and loudly become concerned with the deficit again. Also, even if Biden defends his actions *truthfully* (it took a lot of time and effort to clean up the shit DJT took on all of us) it will be easily cast as DiViSiVe rHeToRiC by the Hannitys and Carlsons of the world. 

Sadly, very few Republicans in Congress are calling him out on his behavior. And I expect ALL of them know what’s coming and ALL will use the above-mentioned political capital in the next election cycle. Even the “good guys” like Romney will talk a nice game while PAC money will blanket their districts with messages that cater to the above.  

The natural response for Dems has been to fight this type of attack by fiercely shining light on the wrongdoings, expecting logic and reason in win over conservative voters who will rebuke such political games that are damaging to our country. But we’ve seen that this tactic doesn’t work, and that conservative voters will largely vote for conservative candidates even if they’re incapable of defending the candidate’s actions.

Is it the stock market? Is it corporations? Is it private investment?  Is it business owners that do not produce anything themselves?

Hopefully this example gives an idea of where my head is at.  What point in this process is only possible in a capitalist system? Is there a divergent path that could be taken using a different economic system and where would you say it is?

1. Let’s say you start making food in your kitchen and selling it your neighborhood.  

2. It becomes popular enough that you can afford to purchase a space specifically for the purpose of making food to sell.  

3. Demand for your food increases and you must pay laborers a wage in order to make food fast enough to meet that demand.

4.  Word of your food has traveled to nearby towns.  You decide to purchase another location in one of those towns to produce food local to them.  You split your time between these locations and hire more laborers.

5.   You’ve opened even more locations and it has become impossible for you to spend time at all of them.  You hire and train specialized laborers (managers) to replace your labor at all but your first location where you still produce food yourself.

6. In order to protect yourself, you register your food production with the government as a corporation.  In the event your business fails, your personal property is insulated from legal issues or financial disputes.

7.  You decide to hire another manager for the first location to take your place.  You no longer personally produce food and instead collect the profits from all of your locations while doing no labor yourself.

8.  A wealthy patron offers to give you a large sum of money to further expand your food production into new areas. In exchange they will also receive a portion of the profits while providing no physical labor.

9.  Your business continues to grow and more wealthy patrons give you money to expand and they also receive a portion of the profits.

10A. Your wealthy patrons believe that if you are the sole owner of the business, growth will stall.  They ask you to restructure your business so that ownership is broken up into pieces called “shares”. Whomever owns the majority of these shares can control the decisions behind business operations.  Anyone may purchase as few or as many shares as they can afford.

10B. Your business continues to grow, however another much larger food producing business has asked to purchase control of all of your assets and intellectual property in exchange for a substantial lump sum of money.  You would no longer be associated with the food you initially produced in any way.

94,Are you optimistic about the long-term prospects of the United States?,"Something I'll admit to admiring about Trump was that he campaigned in 2016 on a sense of crisis and urgency. He didn't pretend that America was basically perfect, needing only a few tweaks here and there--he spoke of decline, of carnage, America as actually experienced by the downwardly mobile. As addicts know, the first step is admitting to having a problem. Clinton lost the election when she retorted with ""America is great because America is good"", something only a toddler could believe. Of course, once he pivoted to ""Keep America Great"" even while a pandemic spread like a prairie fire, he trafficked in the same delusional optimism.

Biden, too, spoke of crisis, but the crisis he spoke of was that Trump is president. Otherwise, he reassured us that ""nothing would fundamentally change"". Like Trump, he offered nostalgic visions of a once-great America, which he dated to 2012. I've long worried that the focus on Trump as being the single most urgent problem in the country will blind liberals to the secular trends that are actually responsible for all the misery in America. Life expectancy peaked and declined under Obama, and the factors driving that decline were the products of decades of bipartisan policy, which Biden helped form. And for facilitating the hollowing out the country, he's been rewarded with the presidency.

When the Soviet Union published mortality statistics in the seventies showing a decline in life expectancy, the first time it had ever happened in an industrialized country in peacetime, Soviet demographers were so embarrassed that they stopped publishing detailed statistics. Their censorship at least indicates some understanding that this is an indictment of their system, which, let's not forget, collapsed soon after. In America, the facts are openly available, but no one seems to connect these facts to the failure of their system or to the failings of the same geriatric politicians still demanding our support. There is simply no pressure to stem the bleeding, so the blood will continue to flow. I see no reasons to be optimistic.",AskALiberal,1606041826

&gt;For more than a week, a plain-spoken former federal prosecutor named Sidney Powell made the rounds on right-wing talk radio and cable news, facing little pushback as she laid out a conspiracy theory that Venezuela, Cuba and other “communist” interests had used a secret algorithm to hack into voting machines and steal millions of votes from President Trump.

&gt;So it came as most unwelcome news to the president’s defenders when Tucker Carlson, host of an 8 p.m. Fox News show and a confidant of Mr. Trump, dissected Ms. Powell’s claims as unreliable and unproven.

&gt;“What Powell was describing would amount to the single greatest crime in American history,” Mr. Carlson said on Thursday night, his voice ringing with incredulity in a 10-minute monologue at the top of his show. “Millions of votes stolen in a day. Democracy destroyed. The end of our centuries-old system of government.” But, he said, when he invited Ms. Powell on his show to share her evidence, she became “angry and told us to stop contacting her.”

&gt;The response was immediate, and hostile. The president’s allies in conservative media and their legions of devoted Trump fans quickly closed ranks behind Ms. Powell and her case on behalf of the president, accusing the Fox host of betrayal.",AskALiberal,1605955131

21,How effective are drug rehab programs NOT directed/mandated by law enforcement? Far superior to court-mandated programs?,"I believe the proper term is *outreach.*  Voluntary.  Drug addicts, chronic users or homeless who want to sober up voluntarily attend programs, at the behest of social workers conducting outreach. And some might be *walk-ins.*

The addicts and drunks (many homeless) hanging out daily in my city's main park receive dutiful visits by social workers every two weeks to try to get them into treatment. Most reject it. Some have been there for 5 years. At 24 visits per year...multiply it out.

Lack of interest in rehab programs is not surprising: Many drug users, addicts and alcoholics are fine with their lifestyles. Aside from heroin, a particularly nasty addiction, other types of hard drugs, e.g., meth, coke, allow semi-controlled chronic use for long periods.  Many chronic users don't respond to appeals from drug-rehab counselors.   A post I submitted to Ask Social Science several days ago: 

[What does Social Science think of the assertion from America's national police organization that incarceration of drug addicts, or the threat of it, is one of the best ways to get addicts into treatment?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskSocialScience/comments/jwc9u5/what_does_social_science_think_of_the_assertion/)

2018 Report from the Police Executive Research Forum: [The Police Response to Homelessness](https://www.policeforum.org/assets/PoliceResponsetoHomelessness.pdf).  Excerpts, p. 8-9:

(headline of section:)  Unintended Consequences: Criminal justice reform in California removed
incentives to enter drug treatment.

&gt;...a measure called Proposition 47 is resulting in more low-level drug offenders on the street, and fewer in treatment. Approved by California voters in November 2014, Proposition 47 downgraded a wide range of theft and drug offenses from felonies to misdemeanors. Many suspects accused of these crimes now receive only a citation and little chance of jail time.

&gt;One consequence of Proposition 47 is that without the threat of incarceration, the justice system lost much of the leverage it once had to get people into drug treatment programs.

&gt;“Low-level drug offenses became misdemeanors. In California, that’s a citation, no matter how many times you’re caught, so there’s no incentive to stop reoffending,” said Los Angeles County Sheriff Jim McDonnell, whose agency operates the largest jail in the nation and is the second largest police agency in the United States. “Before, people facing jail time would eventually accept treatment, but now that leverage is gone. And the number of people in treatment went down after that.”

- - - -

(Only received one abortive response, too bad.)    Certainly police forcing addicts and other problem people  into treatment should *not* be the only rehab model, but the Rehabilitation/Reintegration programs  we hear so much from the Left have appear to have low participation.

Is this primarily a problem of funding (which we hear frequent reference to)?   So if the Biden administration helps secure more monies for rehab programs and that results in large cadres of social workers on the streets interacting with people with drug and other issues, that will make the difference to pull large numbers of these people--*voluntarily*--into treatment?

And simultaneously the broad move to **reduce** police involvement in drug crimes, e.g., California's Prop 47 and Oregon: [...first state to decriminalize small amounts of heroin and other street drugs](https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/09/politics/oregon-decriminalize-drugs-trnd/index.html)  should be continued across America, that is:  Reduce role of police nationwide in compelling drug addicts to attend rehab?

My whole family especially grandparents are really into US politics, they are all republican supporters. The amount of comments I'm hearing everyday about how Biden and the democrats are for socialism and communism is crazy. I don't know much about american politics so I don't want to get involved in their discussions. One common thing I'm hearing out of my grandparents is that only liberals/democrats have intentions to hurt the economy by doing lock downs. While trump would never do such a thing/ republican states in america are doing the right thing by not locking down while states like LA are locking down "" for no reason"". So apparently my grandparents have the thinking that lockdowns= communist leaders (especially democrats) who want to hurt the economy. 

Now just earlier in Toronto, Doug Ford just made an announcement that Toronto is going into lockdown starting Monday. My grandmother who rarely is into Canadian politics said out of no where ""this was probably Justin Trudeaus idea, only liberals would do such thing to lock down the economy"". Then I said how Doug Ford is a conservatives leader who makes decisions for Ontario which is the region i'm living in. I had to emphasize and made sure that she doesn't think american democrats translates to decisions in Ontario Canada. After I said that she responded with how there are plenty of conservative's leaders who are communinst supporters.

&gt;During his ten years in Congress, Richmond has received roughly $341,000 from donors in the oil and gas industry — the fifth-highest total among House Democrats, according to previous reporting by Sludge. That includes corporate political action committee donations of $50,000 from Entergy, an electric and natural gas utility; $40,000 from ExxonMobil; and $10,000 apiece from oil companies Chevron, Phillips 66, and Valero Energy.

&gt;Richmond has raked in that money while representing a congressional district that is home to seven of the ten most air-polluted census tracts in the country.

&gt;Richmond has repeatedly broken with his party on major climate and environmental votes. During the climate crisis that has battered his home state of Louisiana, Richmond has joined with Republicans to vote to increase fossil fuel exports and promote pipeline development. He also voted against Democratic legislation to place pollution limits on fracking — and he voted for GOP legislation to limit the Obama administration’s authority to more stringently regulate the practice.

60,How to garner support for the Work From Home privilege tax?,"As we delve deeper into the pandemic, there's becoming a clear separation between income groups due to shutdowns and restrictions. States like Washington have shut down entire industries without giving those who lose their jobs the financial support they need to survive, especially during a COVID surge right before the holidays. Yes, you can blame the federal government for not working to get these people the money they need, but for some strange reason, blaming people doesn't put money in their pockets when they need it *now*.

In order to compensate for a growing income divide, where workers (mostly white) are able to work from home and not lose their jobs, there should absolutely be a privilege tax. *This is only an attempt to stop the income divide from getting bigger, leading to greater problems*.

A 5% tax on WFH employees would generate revenue that could be used to help workers who have either lost their jobs or are directly in the line of fire due to the covid surge. It's also a wonderful way to address white privilege in the US, where minorities are being nailed harder by covid due to the nature of their jobs, which they are now losing.

If we want to stop 12 million people from going homeless at the end of the year, we can either wait for the federal government (who will do nothing) to step in, or we can raise WFH taxes on local and state levels to support the most vulnerable.

Rural and right leaning suburban voters predominantly get their news from talk radio (Rush Limbaugh, Glenn Beck, etc.), from local news which is dominated by [Sinclair Broadcast Group](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWLjYJ4BzvI&amp;ab_channel=AndrewW), and from Fox News. Let's just say these media groups don't have the most journalistic integrity. If you actually watch and listen to them (I do to get a better understanding of American conservativism), they are basically propaganda built to otherize immigrants and people of color. They depict BLM as a crazy, extremist group. They depict Democrats as anti-Christian socialists that want to take away all their guns.

Given all this I've had a very doomer outlook on politics. What's the point of canvasing, campaigning, donating to political causes, if these people are just going to blindly believe what Tucker Carlson or Rush Limbaugh tells them.

But these are very few videos and self-criticism pretty watered down or nearly nonexistent. When it comes to homelessness in cities like Los Angeles, Seattle, Portland there seems to be lack of think tank videos from liberal side challenging ineffective or not effective enough policies by mayors or suggesting more effective measures to improve lives not just of homeless but also quality of life surrounding homeless camps. In their void, you have a lot of conservative think tank videos, some with reputation of strong links to conspiracy theories like Falung Gong running California Insider - Epoch Times that seems to well master the narrative of the true reality of California’s homelessness and rising COL and declining quality of life issues, but the way they cover these issues  appear balanced but  subtly carry a right-wing conservative message: Democrats destroy cities, destroy middle class, elect Republicans etc (while in fact corruption touches Democrats and Republicans alike and if Republicans always managed states like heaven, then one just need to take look at states like Alaska or Arkansas).

I have been trying to find a video on YouTube covering similar issues like on this video from Democrats perspective but seem very hard to find. 

Here is the video although biased in favor of bashing any Democratic policies that cover well California issues, guess what - even stating thats not Democrat or Republican issue, but one party state issue:

https://youtu.be/IvFoZtsL6a0

But then they don't back example where in any state, two-party system works well let alone they did not give any coverage to purple states like Colorado. We know how this has worked in federal level and it has not been pretty, especially since 1994 when bipartisanship cooperation between Democrats and Republicans ended. Also we have seen evidence that whenever Republicans took control of federal government, it follows by economic recession. 

Then you have videos by people like Robert Reich that makes fantastic videos but also seem to be biased only in favor of Democrats and failing to acknowledge their shortcomings in governing.

https://youtu.be/1KKCXJ6WesU

He is somewhat right, but due to stagnation and corruption in CA Democrat's party, our increasing high taxes don't go far enough to improve local quality of life and it mostly feels like it goes to void while providing nothing in return. Despite having some of the highest taxes in nation, CA has one of the worst condition of freeways in the states trailing only Rhode Island, with Hawaii having better road conditions. 

Am I the only one perceive on state level Republicans run state better but on federal level  Democrats run better.

I genuinely don't see 1 single positive with this move.

This plan will provide far less relief than the other in both the amount of debt canceled and the number of people this will reach.

This plan has to pass through congress since it's apart of the HEROS Act, so it will be much slower than an executive order (and possibly not even pass at all), as well as be watered down *even more* by going through a republican senate.

To top it off, since this seeks to cancel private loans instead of government backed ones, it's far more legally dubious (thus much more likely to get struck down in conservative courts) since almost everyone agrees the president *does* have control over federal student loans.

Even Chuck Schumer (among others) is fully on board with the president canceling 50 grand of public loans for everyone.

20,What are your normative ethics like? E.g. your own balance between deontology versus consequentialism? Do you think conservatives tend towards the former and progressives towards the latter? Why or why not?,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deontological_ethics

&gt;In moral philosophy, deontological ethics or deontology (from Greek: δέον, 'obligation, duty' + λόγος, 'study') is the normative ethical theory that the morality of an action should be based on whether that action itself is right or wrong under a series of rules, rather than based on the consequences of the action.[1] It is sometimes described as duty-, obligation-, or rule-based ethics.[2][3] Deontological ethics is commonly contrasted to consequentialism,[4] virtue ethics, and pragmatic ethics. In this terminology, action is more important than the consequences. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consequentialism

&gt;Consequentialism is a class of normative, teleological ethical theories that holds that the consequences of one's conduct are the ultimate basis for any judgment about the rightness or wrongness of that conduct. Thus, from a consequentialist standpoint, a morally right act (or omission from acting) is one that will produce a good outcome. Consequentialism, along with eudaimonism, falls under the broader category of teleological ethics, a group of views which claim that the moral value of any act consists in its tendency to produce things of intrinsic value.[1] Consequentialists hold in general that an act is right if and only if the act (or on some views, the rule under which it falls) will produce, will probably produce, or is intended to produce, a greater balance of good over evil than any available alternative. Different consequentialist theories differ in how they define moral goods, with chief candidates including pleasure, the absence of pain, the satisfaction of one's preferences, and broader notions of the ""general good"".

Various formulations of the ""trolley problem"" are commonly given to provoke thoughts on this subject.

I am wondering where people in this sub feel they fall between these two views. Some arbitrary questions to help prompt ideas; don't feel a need to answer all of these:

Do you think conservatives tend towards deontology and progressives towards consequentialism? Why or why not?

What is your own stance? How much and in what areas are you for deontology or consequentialism? Bonus points for anyone who has a different normative ethics than these!

What would you say the best argument is for your stance on deontology versus consequentialism or whatever your own normative ethics are? What about against it?

In cases of consequentialism, what are some of the moral goods you want to see maximized?

In cases of deontology, what are some of the moral obligations to be followed? Where do they come from?

39,Did welfare contribute to the rise in black single-parent homes?,"Seems to be that welfare didn't really impact whites but, it did impact blacks.

Because blacks on average have lower incomes than whites, they are more affected by changes in welfare benefits. As a result, the rise in welfare benefits in the 1960s may have had only a small impact on the white shotgun rate but resulted in a significant decrease in the black shotgun marriage rate.

Are broke people really having kids, strategically, to maximize the welfare benefits they receive? Even with the kid, they are still broke

42,What are your thoughts on gun ownership among liberals?,"Let me start out by saying that I'm hugely in favor of gun control.

Coastal elites (and I am definitely one of them) have this reluctance when it comes to gun ownership. And married to an Aussie Dane, I certainly share that perspective.

However recent events have definitely changed my perspective somewhat. I think an armed citizenry could be important, even if it's just as a deterrent. There was a part of me that was ready to march to Washington if the election had been stolen, and I worry that this is not the first time something like this would happen. And maybe that deterrent will be better served with armed citizenry.

These past four years have made me think that it's important for both liberals and people of color to own guns and be able to defend themselves. We've always been on the receiving end of this battle, being defensive. Perhaps it's time to change the narrative.

It's evident that accounting for 70% of the economy still gives us less say in the direction of this country, so maybe the answer is brute force. And I think maybe it's just as important for the left to be armed and ready as the right.

Gandhi's quote on ""An eye of an eye will end up leaving the whole world blind"" comes to mind, but I still find myself wanting to get my gun safety certificate and a license. 

Now, I am still in favor of gun-control. I don't think people need to own crazy semi-automatics and I certainly think there needs to be background checks and mental health assessment and periodic recertification.

So are there any other fellow liberals who are gun owners? What's your perspective?",AskALiberal,1605634375

It’s really easy to point the finger after the fact and criticize leaders for not responding the right way. And yes, cases are on the rise, so some criticism is definitely deserved. However, do you believe that the COVID situation in America is a result of American individualism as opposed to government inaction?

49,"I used to be a liberal 4 years ago, but I'm becoming more hateful the more time passes, what can I do?","Hey guys, i don't know if my case is unique or maybe its actually not, but long story short:

I used to be a liberal in my early 20s, i would advocate for injustices and race equality issues, LGBT rights and such, but these days, bit by bit i've grown more cynical and hateful.

My own reasoning is: Woke culture has infected the world, women/black/LGBT people are taking the spotlight and are making every single enjoyable thing into a political statement. It has made me exceedingly angrier and annoyed by media, pop culture and such, i despise safe space mentalities and i think the world is slowly turning weaker and dumber, where a character is judged by what people identify as, rather than them as people.

Now keep in mind, the only reason i'm posting this is because i realize that although i hold this opinion, and i believe it's valid, the hate i've started  to develop towards women, minorities(even though i am one), and LGBT means that this train of thought is not productive and i actually might be the wrong one.

Maybe wokeness isn't actually so bad, and some people are extreme about it for sure, but they are the small small minority.

It's affecting me mentally a lot, media i enjoy is ruined when i see a woman take the spotlight, if i see any black inclusion my brain instantly defaults to tokenism, when i see someone on twitter with a pronoun description i instantly judge them as snowflakes.

My entire point is this: I've tried a lot in the last year, from therapy ,to doing big life decisions, to trying to dispute my own thoughts, to expanding my social network but nothing is working.

My mind is stuck on a gridlock of ""I'm right, and the world is wrong, this stupid woke culture is ruining everything, common sense is out of the window, i sometimes feel like the only one who is sane"".

4 years ago when BLM started protesting i was so happy and supported the movement, today i hate hearing their name pop up and i think they are a bunch of thugs rioting and looting.

4 years ago when trump won i almost lost my mind, how can someone so racist and hateful win, yet today i'm sad he didnt win this time to make the liberals mad.

You all can judge me if you want, but really i'm asking for help here, because i understand this behavior is not normal, hating women is not normal, hating trans is not normal, thinking every liberal person on social media is a special snowflake who is complaining for no reason is not a good way to think or live my life.

Logically i see the weaknesses in my stance, women are 50% of the population, they should have just as many rights as men, black people being treated as criminals despite doing nothing is terrible, we should do something about that, trans people face so many issues in this world, calling them gender creating snowflakes is mean and harmful, when all they want is to be proud of the gender they want to be.

How do i go back..or better yet, how do i move forward as a former liberal and stop being someone who hates minorities,women and LGBT community?

Edit: I just wanted to thank each and every single person who commented here no matter what you said, i'm quitting social media and will install blockers, however i will bookmark this thread because it's absolute gold. The disputations you all have provided me are fantastic and will help in my therapy too, i think i'll print out a copy of all the biggest comment replies, i hope i can slowly change my mind and be a more open, happy and inclusive person and slowly get rid of the hate.",AskALiberal,1605624628

From the article:

&gt; Raffensperger said Graham questioned whether ballots with mismatched signatures were wrongly accepted because of election workers holding political bias towards Democrats, and asked if Raffensperger himself could throw out all the mail ballots cast in counties with higher than average rates of ballots being flagged for signature issues. 

I sincerely fear my fellow Americans are getting to the point where they don’t believe I personally have a right to vote if it’s gonna be for someone they disapprove of. I was hoping that congress people would be above that sort of insanity but apparently that isn’t true. Lindsey Graham legitimately wants to have counties worth of mail in ballots tossed because he believes democrats were behind some insane conspiracy

Trump much credit for the Moderna vaccine when it was fully part of Operation Warp Speed?,"Last week, I asked this sub the question of why Trump wasn't getting much credit for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. In response, I got a number of convincing answers that said that 

* because the vaccine was developed in Germany with work starting in January, 
* because BioNTech only got funding from Germany and the EU, 
* because Pfizer took no money and won't even use U.S.-provided logistics, and 
* because the U.S.'s only contribution was a non-binding purchase order that was duplicated by Japan, the UK, the EU, and China (via Fosun),

3) Successful implementation of progressive policies at the state level would make them much more popular at the national level.

4) It would provide a test bed for any unforeseen errors.  Better to discover these in a political environment that will make adjustments in good faith rather than leverage a small failure as a reason to throw out the program entirely.

87,How bad would the economy be if the government never bailed out Wall Street in 08/09,"I watched a documentary which featured a lot of the main players of the bailout ie Obama, Bush, Bush’s sec of state Henry Paulson, Obama’s sec of treasury Timothy Geithner and a lot of the CEO’s of the struggling Banks at the time and one thing they reiterated over and over again is how much worse the economy would have been if the gov let the banks fail. Sec of treasury Henry Paulson was the most vocal that if he didn’t push for the bailout, the U.S would have been a depression. Another thing I noticed was toward the end they slickly mentioned the bonuses the CEOs got anyways because they were ‘contractually’ obligated to get them and never mentioned it again and that made me somewhat suspicious. They also mentioned that the fed gov made a ‘50’ billion profit at the end when they paid it all back but I’m not sure if they were only talking about AIG only",AskALiberal,1605501410

In part, they're attacking Fox News because they acknowledged Joe Biden as winning the election.

My question is: how should we feel about this? There's no doubt that Fox is extremely biased in favor of Republicans (including Donald Trump). However, if Republicans abandon Fox News, it's likely they will converge on something even further from reality.

Also, the Soviet training facility mocked up to do drills for an invasion of an American town is in my eyes probably a thing the USSR did in the cold war but I can't find evidence of it.

12,What lessons can the Democrats learn from Trump?,"[In this article](https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/11/13/elissa-slotkin-braces-for-a-democratic-civil-war-436301) Rep. Elissa Slotkin, a moderate Democrat in a district Trump has won twice says there are lessons to be learned from Trump, namely in putting political correctness to the wayside and not looking down on voters. 


&gt;This was a central thesis of Slotkin’s argument. It has long been perceived that Democrats, in the post-9/11 era, are the party of inclusion and big-tent politics. But Slotkin has begun to question that notion. She fears that Democrats have created a barrier to entry, largely along cultural lines, that makes the party fundamentally unwelcoming to anyone with supposedly retrograde views of the world around them.....There are millions of voters—working-class whites and working-class minorities—whose stances on social controversies put them out of touch with the Democratic Party. It’s a truth they might be willing to overlook, if only the party could do the same.

Later in the article, Slotkin takes issue with the idea that young and bold leaders must also be leftists:

&gt; “What bothers me a little bit is that we have this false dichotomy—either you’re young and bold and have big ideas and you’re passionate, or you’re old and moderate and boring and pragmatic. I hope this bench of leaders that are coming up in the freshmen class, my closest peers, are going to just explode that stereotype. Because I’m as passionate as the next person. I believe deeply in change on the issues I care about. I don’t think I’m that boring and I don’t consider myself that old. So, we have to break through that. But in the meantime, you represent your district. Don’t tell me how to represent mine when you come from New York or California.”

Later:

&gt; “I think that’s the real strategic problem for the Democratic Party. It’s not any one line of attack; it’s not any one slogan. It’s that the underlying brand is mushy. And until we get that right, until we really work that out, we’re going to have a problem every two years.”

54,"So Trump has been defeated, but Trumpism survives, and the voters didn't reject the republicans for standing by him. The democratic left has been relatively unified this time around - can they keep it together for the next 4 years?","The narrative that seems to be forming is that the democratic party was remarkably unified and controlled during the campaign. Can this be credited with turning out enough votes to get Biden elected?

There was always going to be more work to do, but how should that work proceed? There were enough voters who disliked Trump enough to vote for Biden, but still don't buy into democratic ideas enough to vote dem down ticket.

I can see the old schisms appearing now: the moderates and establishment are saying that the progressive slogans like ""defund the police"" frightened middle of the road voters who stuck with R downticket. On the other hand the progressives are saying that the old Dems didn't offer real change.

So will the left continue to eat itself over the next four years? Progressive criticism of Biden could damage his brand enough to discourage 2024 votes (""both sides are the same, man!"") and sticking to a more centrist position could wind up keeping or converting independents. The ""real change"" voters that the progressive left insist are out there in this scenario must still have stayed at home, this last time. (But maybe there's lots of them, but only in blue strongholds to start with.)

I'm not sure I have a single question to ask here. My personal opinion as a massive lefty is that the system needs a radical shift still, but American democratic mechanisms don't work like that, and a slightly left of centre neoliberalist message will be better (if not ideal) for big projects like tackling climate change and maintaining global stability; particularly since the electoral college or first past the post voting aren't going away any time soon.

55,"In the event voter fraud is found, what do you want to happen?","Howdy y'all,

I've never posted here but I was curious what the general perception was on something and I thought this was a good place to ask.

I voted for Donald Trump (not because I'm a big fan of his, just because I consider him the lesser of two evils). Not surprisingly, I wasn't particularly stoked when he lost. I've seen some stuff about voter fraud, particularly related to the software company Dominion, on more conservative news sites and such, but I haven't seen any mention of it on more left leaning news sites (it is very possible I've missed them, I don't really have a ton of time to keep up with the news). (And I do recognize that there may be nothing to these claims but frankly I don't trust the news coming out from either side so I don't see a point in arguing about the legitimacy of these claims at all until there's more evidence either way).

I was mostly wondering what y'all thought about it? Not in an accusatory way obviously. If it turns out the election was fraudulent and evidence is found that Trump won what do you think should happen? I know how I'd feel if the situation was reversed and I was wondering if it was the same on this side.

Thanks!",AskALiberal,1605333301

68,"Was the election about ""socialism"" after all?","So, just something I've been thinking about the past few days. Maybe there is something to the election being about ""socialism"". However, it's not what you think. No, it's not bernie or the squad that alienated voters...it's Biden himself. 

This election very well could have been about the economy though, but in a different way. I recently saw one of my view stealth trump supporter friends out themselves on social media lately. They basically said something along the lines of ""oh great, now I'll be stuck inside on my birthday"", referring to the idea of a Joe Biden lock down. And it hit me. Was that why 71 million people voted for Donald Trump? Lockdowns?

Let's do a brief history of how the political dynamics of this year unfolded. The pandemic hit in march. We shut the country down, but then because the orange crapstain saw what it was doing to the economy and how that was his meal ticket to reelection, he decided to reopen everything again. 

From there, we've had a very contentious and divisive battle in this country over COVID take place at the state level. In PA, where I am, we had Tom Wolf take swift action against COVID and he managed to control the disease for most of this year. Social distancing worked, masks worked, but the whole process made people unhappy. And economics has been on peoples' minds all year.

Meanwhile, what was the right arguing for? Open it all up. Let covid roll over people and if they die they die. We need to get the economy running again. We need people employed, we need restaurants, movie theaters, etc. open. And honestly? The democrats were being portrayed as ""socialists"" for wanting to keep everything closed. The idea was that the democrats want to take over and control the economy with COVID lockdowns and they equated this to socialism, and this is something people didn't like.

Americans have a terrible track record of being told what to do. Remember Jimmy Carter during the oil crisis? ""Wear a sweater"". The American people mocked him and voted for Reagan. They didn't want to be told what to do. They wanted to burn as much oil as they wanted, and this allowed conservatism to flourish for decades. ""Drill baby drill"" and climate change denialism became standard republican politics since. And it was popular. Because it allowed americans go back to their normal lives. People dont like change. They dont like being told they cant drive as much, or that they gotta turn the heat or AC down. They wanna do whatever they want, darn the consequences. That's the american way, that's freedom.

Same thing here. A lot of americans DO NOT like this lock down stuff. here in PA, republicans have tried to impeach wolf over it. In other states militias stormed state capitols and even threatened to kidnap the michigan governor. In the south, they reopened and allowed the first wave of covid to never really end, but people were allowed to party and eat in restaurants and what have you.

But that's what a lot of people want. They dont like being isolated. They don't like being told they cant live their lives. And because americans are selfish, they fight simple things like being told to wear a mask, stay 6 feet from others, or that they can't have their little luxuries. 

Could it be, that the big thing we on the left are missing, is that the huge polarizing issue this year was covid, for better or worse? And that it doesnt matter how moderate or extreme democrats are on other issues, what matters is all democrats want to lock down the economy to control the spread of this virus and because americans are selfish people who dont like to be told what to do they voted for the dude who would give them what they want even if it wasn't best for the country?

Just a thought I've been having. We fight over whether biden was too far left on things like healthcare, but when I think about it it's probably miniscule in peoples' minds compared to covid. A lot of people are in unstable economic situations. They cant work, the unemployment system isnt working well, congress has been useless at passing stimulus, and they just want to go back to ""normal"". And considering the cold war soviet bread line imagery being used with the covid lockdowns, that probably has way more fear in the american peoples' hearts than the idea of government healthcare.

idk, what do you guys think? Am I on the right track here? 

I know most of us are probably pro lockdown. I mean I'm probably more extreme than most on the matter. But I know a lot of americans can't seem to stomach the thought of the democrats in charge right now simply because of the covid stuff.

Personally, I guess is that he will place his library somewhere in Florida or NYC, but most likely Florida since it is way more friendly territory.  

As to contents, it will likely be a mixture of pictures, memos, and video clips of the ""bright spots"" of his presidency.  I am most curious if his Tweets will be stored and displayed there somehow.  

The idea of his presidential library being an honest reflection of his presidency is somewhat laughable. There certainly will be documents stored there from negative times of his presidency, but those will most likely be kept in storage while more positive materials will be more prominently on display. 

Despite my antipathy toward #45 on moral and political grounds, I might consider touring it for kicks as long as I knew no entrance fees were going into Trump's pocket directly (which I believe any fees go toward maintenance of the library).

81,"Do you think future Democratic presidential campaigns will feel more like Clinton's in 2016, or Biden's in 2020?","Hillary Clinton's 2016 messaging IMO focused way more explicitly on stopping racism and sexism. With diversity (in those two respects) being one of the main tenants of her campaign. Which was also bolstered by her long-standing relationships to those communities and her longtime advocacy for women's rights. 

Whereas Joe Biden's campaign messaging was what I'd describe as portraying himself as a ""moderate Rust Belt Bernie Sanders"". His messaging seemed to focus way more on building an overly broad coalition (case in point: trying to appeal to disaffected republicans and democratic socialists) that didn't emphasize those two types of diversity that Clinton did in 2016 to the degree she did. Even if they were still there, they weren't as front-and-center as in 2016. Even so, I'd argue his portrayal of diversity was broader (Having a Trans Woman and a Kid with a Stutter speaking at the 2020 DNC). Which goes to show how much the Democratic party wanted to go all-in on the big tent concept this year.

So in 2024,2028,2032,2036,etc. Are we more likely to see Clinton-Style campaigns that's core tenant is appealing to the changing face of America? Or Biden-Style campaigns that's core tenant is establishing an overly broad big tent?",AskALiberal,1605268918

The GOP made officially sanctioned groups called ""Trump Pride"" and ""Muslims for Trump"" (part of Trump's official campaign website) which you wouldn't see during the Reagan or Bush years.

Trump's Evangelical Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, wanted the administration to do a crackdown on cannabis. To his dismay, it didn't happen. In fact, heavily Republican states like South Dakota and Montana voted to legalize it entirely.

I made the foolish mistake of getting into a political argument with a past teacher (who vehemently claims the election was fraud). He tagged me in this post and asked me to fact check it: 

 

&gt;A whistle blower comes forward - The main stream media does not cover it.   
Since the regular media won't cover it- indy or right wing media is the only place talking about it.  
So when you post links to the indy or right wing media, democrats immediately dismiss it because of the source.   
Then the MSM finally covers this story it is only when the WaPo declares that the whistle blower recants. (even though the WaPo had no statement from the witness)  
\- Only the whistle blower immediately released a video after the WaPo article came out saying that he DID NOT recant. And he reiterated his same story and asked the WaPo for a correction.  
The MSM does not cover that part.   
Only indy and right media covers it.   
But if you talk about it, Democrats dismiss your source, because only their source--which won't cover it--can.    
So then you see democrats saying that he recanted, and you show them his video saying that is a lie and him demanding a retraction from the WaPo, they dismiss you because the only news sources showing his video are indy or right.  Meanwhile the headlines and side bar articles still say the WaPo's line, ignoring the actual source entirely.   
And THEN it comes out that there is a two hour long recording with United States Federal Agents grilling and intimidating the whistle blower, and the entire two hour unedited file is dumped onto the internet... democrats immediately dismiss it and don't listen to it because they declare it is illegal to record feds intimidating witnesses.   
(it was also illegal for someone to leak Trump's taxes but that didn't seem to hold them back!)   
So obviously the real problem isn't feds intimidating whistle blowers, it is people talking about feds intimidating whistle blowers. Kind of like how vote fraud isn't a problem, but you talking about vote fraud is a terrible divisive evil.

But for the most part, the modern republican will insist that he is not racist, that he is a supporter of individual rights for all (which is a liberal concept), and some newer republicans are even part of LGBT or BLM movements.

First, somebody check my math... right now the popular vote is about 51% for Biden and about 48% for Trump. The states went very nearly even 25/25 (out of 50) for either candidate.  If the EC shakes out with GA/AZ for Biden and NC for Trump, it'll be 306 to 232 which is about 57% to 43%.   So the EC actually looks like a *better* percentage win for Biden over Trump, right?

My excitement for the Biden win has been greatly overshadowed by my concern in having a country where half of the population does not trust our election process. I've always heard conservatives assume that the democrats like to cheat, but its always been conjecture and never appeared to be taken all that seriously. Until now.

Ive of course seen the barrage of accusations being made, some with a little credibility, but most are completely baseless. Ive had a lot of family members sending messages in our group chats about dead people voting, double voting, and even a funny one where my mother in law sent out a 10 second video of Biden saying ""we've created the most accessible and inclusive voter fraud organization in history"" (Which was from a Pod Save America interview, so I was able to debunk that with ease). Ive sense been trying my best to be the fact checker in my family and social circles and trying to debunk any misinformation they send my way, but I am still very concerned about what all this will lead to - both in my personal life and the country in general.

I have since taken the stance with my conservative friends that I will trust the system, and if the election was in fact stolen, we will get to the bottom of it - taking the ""wait and see"" approach. I certainly don't think it was stolen, but I am just amazed at how unbelievably certain all of the conservatives are in Trumps claims, because it truly requires a VERY low opinion of our country, its founding principles, and its emphasis on ""We the People"", in order to get on board with the BS coming from the GOP right now.

But for the sake of the future of our country, do you think we might have jumped the gun on declaring Biden the winner without Trump conceding?

It looks like the end result of Biden's win is less influence for progressive Democrats and ultimately less power for Democrats in the long run, and I wonder if four more years of Trump would have been better for progressives to gain more control of the Democratic Party (taking advantage of the weaken establishment) and expand the House majority in '22 and finally be able to run a Bernie Sanders-style candidate in 2024, potentially win and take the Senate too.

47,Is anyone else worried about the future of mail voting?,"I have, until the last few weeks, been an advocate of vote-by-mail programs. As an Oregon resident I've enjoyed the convenience and comfort of voting from home and I've long thought that such benefits should be extended to voters in other states as well.

But watching the Trump campaign's actions before and after election day have me worried about the future of these systems and whether they can hold up to the 'new normal' of hostile election interference.

To illustrate my point, let's imagine the current election standoff with a twist:

Since election day, the Trump campaign's legal challenges to voting procedures have largely hit a wall for lack of evidence. Judges have left open the door for these challenges to proceed if the Trump campaign can come up with evidence that their allegations are true. At this point it seems as though even a single credible report of mail voting fraud, or even something that looks reasonably *like* fraud, would unleash this wave of challenges on the court system.

We know that leading up to the election, [Russian hackers accessed and stole data from state and local governments](https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/22/politics/russian-hackers-election-data/index.html). What if, instead of accessing voter information, they went after the design files for mail ballots? What if they were to print 1000 or 10000 of these ballots to look like the real thing and then mailed them out to random voters? Or even just dumped them in a parking lot where they'd be found?

With no way to know the extent of something like this as it unfolded, would judges be willing to accept the GOP's accusations and potentially cast out all mailed ballots?

Yes, it's an unlikely scenario, but hardly impossible from my perspective. In my worst nightmares something like this did happen, the Trump campaign knows about it and they're now pressing legal challenges and waiting for the interference to be found, knowing that when it is they'll have the 'ammo' they need, so to speak.

Well, I know what’s wrong with them. I know exactly what it is. It’s my old friend the reality gap.

&gt; Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) on Monday night effectively shot down any chance that Democrats are able to nix the legislative filibuster if they find themselves with control of the Senate next year. 

&gt;Democrats are currently poised to have 48 seats in January and are fighting to win two seats in Georgia that would give the party control of the Senate because in a 50-50 split Vice President Harris could break a tie, giving the party the majority. 

&gt; Manchin, during an interview with Fox News, said that if there's a 50-50 tie that he would not vote to nix the legislative filibuster, a decision that would take it off the table for Democrats. In order to nix the legislative filibuster should they have 50 seats, Democrats would need the support of every member of their caucus including Manchin. 

&gt; ""50-50 means there's a tie. But if one senator does not vote on the Democratic side there is no tie. ... When they talk about, whether it be packing the courts or ending the filibuster, I will not vote to do that,"" Manchin said. 

&gt;Manchin, referring to chatter that Democrats could nix the filibuster and expand the Supreme Court, said he wanted to ""rest those fears for you."" 

&gt;""That won't happen because I will not be the 50th Democrat voting to end that filibuster or to basically stack the court,"" Manchin said.  


I guess this was to be expected, as Manchin is well known for being ~~spineless~~ a moderate Democrat, but I’m still disappointed. I was personally in favor of packing the court and eliminating the filibuster, especially as Republicans seem posed to take the Senate, because it seems like the only way the Democrats will be able to get things done.

Don’t hide your bias.

Make sure to show both sides of the issue despite the fact that the vast majority of Americans don’t identify with either side (registered Democrats and registered Republicans are both minorities among eligible voters.) and the fact that many issues have multiple sides.

It just feels like we expect too much of our journalistic institutions and do not give them the slack and patience to actually do their job and often news orgs that publish corrections and retractions are often ridiculed.

* Millennials/gen Z vote is responsible for getting Biden elected
* African American/Hispanic/Native American vote is responsible for getting Biden elected
* Progressives/Moderates/Republicans for Biden is responsible for getting Biden elected. 
*Women, the educated are responsible for getting Biden elected.  

I know this is likely a natural reaction that happens somewhat each cycle, especially for Democrats who have a much larger tent.  However, it feels like it is a bit “extra” this year. 

Of course the media eat this shit up, but for Democrats I don’t find it necessarily helpful.  Sometime it does feel like Democrats are really bad winners - not in a rub it in your face kind of way, but rather we tend to focus on petty bullshit like this rather than enjoying the win itself.

For the sake of brevity, However, I'll leave them out.

I fear their stated goal to ""tax the hell out of corporations"".  I am closely connected to one that would find it difficult to operate in such an environment.  Prices can't be raised, and costs can't be cut.  That would leave this corporation teetering on the edge of extinction.

I fear their stated goals of ending the Trump tax cuts, which put money in my pocket.  That money went to feeding families other than mine.  That would put that in jeopardy.

I fear the stated goal of expanding Obamacare into Biden care.  I have seen my coverage shrink and my costs increase due to this monstrosity of a ""law"".  An expansion of that into ""medicare for all"" would only have the effect of either raising my taxes and giving me rationed care.

And how does the model deal with recreational drug use?](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskSocialScience/comments/joftau/why_is_the_portugal_model_on_coping_with_illegal/)  Though the post got a fair number of upvotes, it got zero responses.  Perhaps that outcome can  be remedied here.

I might have  inadvertently discouraged discussion by linking an article with some striking perspectives from drug experts in Portugal, e.g.: “there’s no such thing as a soft or hard drug, only healthy and unhealthy relationships with drugs.”  That is quite a debatable topic.  *Asksocialscience* has strict requirements for answering questions, including that comments  1) be “supported by citations” and “social science findings”  and to 2) reflect an absence of opinion. 

That likely precluded any response.  I should have not linked that article.

The second article I linked was more practicable, discussing Portugal’s use of *dissuasion panels.*  We should deduce that the panels do inform people of the potential harms of drugs, and distinguish between marijuana and heroin.   A key discussion point in my OP centered on recreational drug use.  The first article I linked offered this accurate observation:

&gt;Some people are able to use drugs for years without any major disruption to their personal or professional relationships

Indeed they are, and we're talking hard drugs here, not just weed.   How does a *counseling/rehab model* engage with this cohort?  On occasion individuals therein have given a *middle finger* to counselors who inform that because they got busted or turned up dirty on a drug test, they have to be  assessed for addiction. (Mere possession of alcohol does not send someone to an AA counselor.)   

The conservative approach to drug control blends education and punishment.  While the Right has mostly come around and now accepts the need for sympathy and treatment for addicts, it still advocates punishment as a tool to suppress recreational drug use.

To borrow language from Noam Chomsky:  a substantial number of people using hard drugs in restrained fashion represents *the threat of a good example.*   How can a society reduce overall drug use if people perceive they can be part of that group?

32,Both the Democratic and Republican Parties are at a crossroads in my opinion.,"This is where I see each party as it stands today. 

1-10 scale. 1 being far left in general terms, 10 being far right in general terms, 5 being center, also in general terms (we'll exclude labels such as communist, libertarian, anarchist, fascist, etc for the sake of the scale)

*The Democratic Party is a solid 5
The Republican Party is a solid 7.5*

Maybe you agree with this notion, maybe you don't.

More than ever we've seen this play out, The US for various reasons is drifting to the right but many are attempting to stop this to different degrees. Hear me out.

I think both parties are corrupt but I think the Republican Party doesn't want Trump's extremist version of things, similarly, I'm fairly certain the Democratic Party wants nothing to do with progressives.

Unpopular opinion potentially but I think Biden would have been defeated if Trump wasn't on the other side of the ticket. Many standard Republicans likely jumped to Biden likely somewhat validating my Republican side of things. A lot of progressives likely sucked it up because they were also sick of Trump and felt threatened.

Going back to my earlier scale, let's revisit it but splitting up groups, this is all open to interpretation.
 
*The Democratic Party is a still a 5
The Republican Party is still a 7.5
Progressives, etc if a party would be a 3.5
Trump supporters, etc. if a party would be a 9*

We're well beyond the need for multiple competing political parties as it is.

However putting all this together; What do you think happens in the years to come, 2024 election and beyond? 

Both the duopoly of the D's and R's are feeling pressure from within. People within the Republicans want to pull the entire party further right. People within the Democrats want to pull the party further left.

This isn't sustainable, if something doesn't give, you're going to start seeing record 3rd party turnout or record low voting turnout as the ""old guard"" of both parties starts to become the likely minority within their own party and they fight to keep the status quos.

&gt;President-elect Joe Biden unveiled Monday members of his COVID-19 advisory board and it includes Rick Bright, a former Trump administration whistleblower who resigned amid allegations his early warnings over the pandemic were ignored.

&gt;The task force, a group of public health experts – almost all doctors – will offer guidance to Biden, Vice President-elect Kamala Harris and their coronavirus staff as they prepare to take over the presidency. The board's composition could be an indicator of the Biden administration's intent to follow a more science-based coronavirus approach.  

&gt;Biden's 13-member task force is chaired by Vivek Murthy, a former surgeon general; David Kessler, a former Food and Drug Administration commissioner; and Marcella Nunez-Smith, a professor at Yale University. Among the other members are Luciana Borio, a physician and public health expert and previously director for medical and biodefense preparedness on Trump’s National Security Council.

39,How would you like best to legal reduce gun crimes?,"I'm not a big fan of guns, and I'm not very political, so this may all sound dumb, just saying.

The Constitution does protect the people's right to keep and bear arms.  To make it so people couldn't keep guns at all, we'd need a Constitutional Amendment, and everyone knows that can't possibly happen at the moment.

So rather than try to ban some guns for looking scary, which is rife with controversy, why not try to do things that don't have any 2nd Amendment issues?  That would immediately make the liberals look a lot more reasonable for following the letter of the law and not trying to skirt around it which looks like they don't respect the law.  (Not that people on the Right have ANY room to talk about respect for the law, not after the last 4 years holy shit.)

For example, if someone owns a gun, but then it gets stolen and used in a crime, fine the gun owner a punitive amount, because they clearly didn't follow the (new, improved) gun storage laws?

No one is then stopping law-abiding citizens from owning guns, but they are then being held responsible for actually KEEPING them and not letting them into the wrong hands to be used in crimes.

And, obviously, having sorer punishments for any crimes involving guns.

If the Right can remove voting rights for felons, then surely we can also remove gun ownership rights for criminals too, right?  If you use a gun in a crime, even after your sentence is over, you still can't legally own a gun.

Maybe these are already being pushed and this is a stupid post, but I never hear about it, I only hear ""We're going to get the guns"" which, again, I'm no gun fan, but I do want to do things Constitutionally.

What are some other ways to prevent gun deaths that don't run afoul of the 2nd Amendment?

Anyways, here are some false narratives TYT and similar types push that I’m tired of, myself:

1. “Democrats are conservative or right of center in Europe.” Economically, yes. But with regards to inclusiveness for minorities and immigrants, Democratic Party is ahead of the left-wing in other European nations. Also, the US is a more diverse nation with 30% of people being non-whited and racial antagonism makes it difficult to get people to buy into a social welfare programs, as opposed to largely homogenous countries. 

2. “Obama is a war criminal.” Basis for this is Libya. Obama went in there after there was already a civil war, and killed Gaddafi. Libya is now a democracy, and the casualties committed by US forced were less than 10k for the mission, from my understanding. I don’t think that constitutes a war crime, like the way the Iraq War started by Bush was clearly a war crime. 

3. “Reason progressive policies on economic issues don’t get passed is because of “corporate”, “established” Democrats opposing them.” Democrats largely support pushing the country to the left on all sorts of economic issues. It’s Republicans that oppose moving the country to the left on economic issues. It’s misunderstanding the situation entirely and crafting another talking point for Republicans to grift to years later, since the public will be misinformed. 

4. “70% of the American public supports Medicare for All.” Only 40% of the American public support Medicare for All. 70% support the public option, known as Medicare for All who want it. https://www.google.com/amp/s/fivethirtyeight.com/features/medicare-for-all-isnt-that-popular-even-among-democrats/amp/

Anyways, just curious if anyone is bothered by these talking points (and lots of others) coming from these online folks. What they’re doing is just venting a lot of frustration people have, and just spraying it all across the system similar to how Trump and Fox News do, but from the left. I personally don’t trust them, but I’m seeing their opinions repeated more and more. 

Obama was called a war criminal to me just yesterday, and I asked the person what war crime did he commit, and he said Libya, and I asked him what did he do in Libya that was a war crime, and he didn’t have an answer. It’s just that level of thought behind it, but people who are into TYT, just like Fox News people, don’t change their opinion even after they learn it’s wrong, they just double down on it.

74,"Is Joe Biden's gun control plan too lax, too strict or just right?","https://joebiden.com/gunsafety/

I don't have the best trust in Biden's knowledge of guns. 

He once said AR-15's are harder to use and aim than a shotgun, and as a person that has shot both kinds of guns, I disagree with that statement. Shotguns can be hard to master and have significant recoil, unlike most AR-15's. He then said to his wife fire two blasts in the air. In some areas, you could be charged with negligent discharge of a firearm for doing that, not to mention doing that with a double barrel shotgun means you are out of ammo.

Also, Biden's proposed ban of high capacity magazines and assault weapons will impact my father if implemented. He owns a few weapons that may or may not be classified as assault weapons under the proposed law and several high capacity magazines either for a rifle or a pistol. He would either have to turn them into the government or pay over $4,000 in NFA fees to keep them (if each individual item requires a 400 dollar NFA stamp).

Also, banning the online sale of gun parts and ammunition during a time when local stores can barely keep guns and ammo in stock is sure to upset many gun owners in America. Online purchases of firearms go through background checks just like in person purchases.

88,How do we stop the fracturing of America.," (I apologize this is pretty long)

There are very real fractures in America that are getting worse. Racially and demographically. This election has proven that even though a record number of people came out in support for Biden. The support is still there for Trump. It's not faltering. In 2024 were going to be still dealing with this issue.  A couple of decades ago Democrats were the workers party. The people who went to Democrats for that support are starting to find that the Democratic party now cares more for big cities and minority issues. Raising property taxes and health care prices with nothing to show for it in rural counties. Jobs moving over seas and the great recession further hurt more blue collar jobs. The Government isn't working for these people. So when the Republican party tells them that Government doesnt work and then openly screws them over I think it's just a matter of appreciating the honesty. Trump just took these ideas and sold it back to his supporters with no real intention to help them. Trump is just a symptom and I believe voting for Trump was just a middle finger to the system. You don't care about us, so we don't care about you, here's a guy who will fuck everything up and doesn't care about what he says. 
These people that live in rural and blue collar counties don't have to deal with minority issues that much. Homosexuality just isn't talked about. Green and clean energy not important to them. Electric cars are impractical. Don't talk about guns.Their community's are their churches and their religion is very important to them. I can see how issues I care about don't matter to these folk.
2024 could come back with a vengeance. Trump could run again. The Republican party could run another Trump like candidate and they'll vote for him/her because fuck the system. I believe a lot of liberal ideas would work best for these struggling demographics. But I think Democrats have become too focused on wokeness and we come off as smug or better than thou. I don't think our show boasting after Biden's win is helping. And I know some of you will say well they did it to us fuck em. But when does it stop? How do we bridge this divide?

You can't look forward to anything exciting with us in charge.""**. But with Biden/Harris, their messaging is all about change and giving you a future to look forward to. Not just because Trump is awful, but also in order to make a better system than we had before Trump.


* The diversity Biden/Harris advocates for is more broad.

The Biden/Harris campaign's vision of diversity strikes me as more diverse than Clinton/Kaine's. With the campaign featuring recognition of all the groups of people Clinton/Kaine did, while also more heavily featuring others (like disabled people) than they did.

As a European Conservative that mainly follows right leaning or individual journalism my observation was Trump voters believed Trump over preformed mainly cause off these reasons:

1.	⁠Voting for Trump and being right wing has been scrutinised, therefore many Trump supporters didn’t answer polls nor voiced their vote in public.
2.	⁠The Media and popular culture is mainly bias towards the Democrats, especially the corporate media, therefore the polls favouring Biden where both exaggerated and pushed forward the most.
3.	⁠The corporate media and influential popular cultural figures actively used their platforms to scrutinise Trump, both deserved and undeserved, and push positive feedback about Biden and protect him, also both deserved and undeserved.

97,A slew of gun control questions to help me understand the Democratic stance on firearms.,"In an effort to make this concise I will ask a question and give my answer/reasoning. I’d like to see your responses for them.


1. Do you think restricting this right is oppressive and tyrannical?


The first and foremost reason for firearms is they are the best tool when shit hits the fan. Be it total society collapse, zombies, or a tyrant coming into power. Restricting this right, to me, goes hand in hand with you 100% trusting the government (like trusting trump) or thinking people that hold power do not want to hold more of it. There’s a big reason why this right was recognized earlier than slavery (and that reason is racist af lol). The second biggest reason I believe this right is recognized, say before the amendment recognizing the right to a jury, is because it is the protector of all the rights recognized.


2. Do you think limiting firearms is good for the physically weak?


I am a firm believe in guns being an equalizer. A woman or a handicapped person would have a better chance fending off a robbery or a gang rape if she had a fire arm, even if her attackers had one. Think about it, would a 100lbs woman armed with only a knife vs the offending party only armed with knives have a better chance than if both parties had guns? This question is very ambiguous and could go both ways but personally I’ll take my chances with the stick. Now think about this, in America where there are already probably a billion guns, the attacker would probably have a gun in this scenario anyway *even if they are banned* so I wouldn’t take my chances without one *here*.


3. Do you think banning firearms or gun control will be more effective than the war on drugs/prohibition?


Banning firearms would do as much harm legally as the war on drugs or banning abortions. Right now innocent people (and disproportionately more of them are my color) are being locked up over marijuana and I think it is one of the biggest injustices America has in modern times. Banning firearms outright would start another crime war that would specifically target law abiding citizens since people with ill intent will get their weapons regardless of the law, just like how the war on drugs is now. And this also would disproportionately affect POCs more too in its enforcement. The biggest reason I carry is because I’m not letting a damn racist/rapist get to my future mixed black/Hispanic children or my Hispanic wife (although as a 110lbs girl she carries everywhere). And I feel like a lot of minorities have the same reason.


4. Do you think background checks/registries/taxes are effective gun control measures?


I believe in background checks, but with limitations. I think if you have a non violent record, your access should not be prohibited. I don’t believe in having a registry, because it can be (and has been) used to target gun owners when legislation is later passed to outlaw guns. And I believe that carrying your firearm should not be illegal anywhere, and law abiding gun owners should not feel ostracized or be under the threat of law for doing so, since bad actors sure as shit won’t or care. With taxes, I believe this ostracizes the less fortunate or even the middle class if you tc it high enough. This will give immense privilege to the wealthy and is a classist position, using taxes to out price the common man from their right.

5. Do you think banning just the ar-15/“assault” weapons is effective or makes sense?


While they are more efficient guns, they are only responsible for around 1-2% (if that) of gun related homicides in the country. They are used in the top deadliest mass shootings though, but even then mass shooting are a statistical outlier even if just counting gun related homicides. So if a person believes an Ar15 should be banned, then they should also believe hand guns should be banned, which is one reason why I am not for it.


________________________________________________________


Now I am not for complete total arms freedom. Should we citizens have Willy nilly access to explosives? I believe not, since you can’t really be precise with them.

4,What could a Biden Admin do better than the previous Obama admin?,"Trump rose to power by expanding on existing racial tensions, scapegoating BIPOCs as the cause of why many white working class Americans felt left behind as the economy boomed.

Under Obama wage growth was stagnant.

Under Trump, wage growth did actually increase, however many economists suspect the qualified unemployed worker population was so small pre Pandemic that that market force caused the wage increases.

Additionally, wealth inequality has continued to skyrocket.

The status quo of 2016 might be better than the status of quo of 2020 (despite 56% of Americans saying they were better off than 4 years ago during a pandemic.), but the status quo of 2016 is not going to actually solve the underlying issues that made COVID-19 such a wrecking ball.

There’s a real question of what exactly can a Biden administration do better.

I have a feeling every media report from now onwards is going to try to compare everything to Trump and his incoherent and incompetent response to COVID-19 and having a cabinet with the highest net worth ever. I just don’t want to slip back to the days of when the WSJ and NYT were defending The Iraq War. 

I also do not think a Obama admins governing strategy is going to prevent the Republicans form overtaking the House come 2022. (Only state supreme courts can invalidate partisan gerrymandering. Republicans control 23 state legislatures and Dems 15. They will decide the district maps for 2021-2031.)

30,Why this win isn't really a win,"I'm glad the Trump Dump has finally been flushed. However, I'm not really in a celebratory mood. I have this terrible habit of spoiling my own joy and just did so with this thought:

Biden will be 78 yrs old in 13 days. When his four years as POTUS come to a close, he will be 82! Whether or not we think this is too old doesn't matter; cause Joe doesnt. I don't see Biden voluntarily stepping aside to let a young Democrat take the torch.

But he should! Oh dear God he should. Biden was never a fan favorite in any of his runs for prez, and that won't change when he's the incumbent. His one term won't accomplish much (Yertle the Turtle in the Senate will make sure of it), and the Republicans will have had 4 yrs to regroup. They'll run someone like Dan Crenshaw, Tommy Tuberville or Kristi Noem. 

And they'll win. 2024 will continue all Trump started: punitive policies toward immigrants, re-militarizing the police, re-starting the drug war, removing consumer/public protections (aka deregulation), Wall Street/Big Pharma/Big Oil will write the banking/healthcare/energy laws to suit themselves...

38,How do we assimilate Trumpists? (for USA liberals),"I think we can agree that Trump's political legacy needs to be pushed into the incinerator, but we can't deny that he appealed to a large number of people in our country. It might be possible to ostracize a small number of committed racists and the paranoid fringe, but we have to live with the bulk of his supporters. How do we come to an understanding with them? Right now, I feel like lots of people are at each other's throats, and I don't expect this to subside just by voting Trump out of office. 

Some people say that the Democratic party needs to take them more seriously and address their concerns. I'm doubtful that this is possible, because frankly they are often just wrong, and reaching across the aisle means turning our back on someone else.

Some say that they just need to change. Again, I doubt that this is going to happen any time soon. Arguing and marketing won't change them.

The final solution I've heard of is more like social engineering. Putting more money into education and other programs that change society in a way to eliminate the narrow-minded and exclusionary thinking that made Trump appealing.

Everyone is acting as if there was a 70% vote. We must not forget that close to 50% voted both ways. We are extremely split and we need to try and find everything and anything to bring us together or we will continue this 4 years from now.

I was especially surprised that it wasn’t even close, with CA voting it down by 13 percentage points despite the “yes” campaign supposedly outspending the opposition ten-fold.

These people are just repugnant to me.  Bad people.  I just don't like talking to them other than to call them monsters.

**Fanatics**
All your single-issue voters go here.  Nothing really to talk about as nothing else matters to them.

**Apathetic**
These are the voters for the ""Leopards Eating People's Faces Party.""  They lack imagination.  Systemic racism doesn't exist because it hasn't happened to them.  Kids in cages isn't bad because they have never been in a cage or forcibly separated from their parents. These are the people who are willing to ""look past"" horrors because it might mean they save $0.04 on a purchase.  I find talking to them is useless because you can't logic someone into feeling empathy.

**Factually wrong**
Lots of variations here. From the obvious qAnon conspiracy theories to the more nuanced ""small government"" nonsense.  If you drill down far enough, they are just plain wrong.  Republicans are not better for the economy. Deregulation creates externalities and rent-seeking behavior. You would think talking to this group would be more useful than it actually is. Turns out, if facts were important to them they would already know that Biden is not part of a pedophilia ring, that immigration (legal and illegal) provides long term economic benefits, that social safety nets are not a slippery slope to communist labor camps.",AskALiberal,1604765320

I also believe that there has been a lack of charisma with the the previous 2 presidential candidate (Clinton and Biden). Charisma can help people vote for the presidential candidate. This can be especially true for the younger voters. After witnessing 4 years of Trump, I believe that the younger voters will start paying a lot more attention to politics and start pushing for people to vote.

Looking for people to have **productive conversation** with. Like I said, I’m a Libertarian so I think I provide more of an outside perspective on all this. This is absolutely not an attack on anyone, just an observation I’ve made that I’m very curious to hear your opinions on.

I have friends that are all over the political spectrum. I’m also in college, so I have a lot of friends that are considerably far left in their views.

A common theme I’ve noticed with them is that they seem to feel certain that, unless explicitly told otherwise, everyone they know and interact with is also a liberal and has the exact same views as them.

This is shown in their incredible comfort to talk poorly about people right of center very publicly even when politics aren’t even the topic of conversation. Lots of times we’ll be having a conversation about something completely irrelevant to politics and they seem to frequently want to remind everyone how awful they think conservatives are without worrying about how it may come off to other people. Even when I’m sitting at my desk at work, my coworkers are so quick and public to speak poorly about the right, when talking about politics in professional settings was just recently considered to be distasteful. Even when I worked in a convenience store in high school I had customers drop orange man bad-esque comments to me all the time during our 2 minute interactions at the cash register.

It puzzles me a lot, because around 50% of the U.S. is conservative or at least have right-leaning views (shown by the incredibly close popular vote!) but all the liberals I know seem to think that the Republican Party is **entirely** made up of 85-year-old men or farmers that live in the middle of nowhere, instead of the people they see at work, at the store, or interact with on a day-to-day basis. They also seem so genuinely shocked when they find out someone is not also a liberal.

Why do the liberals I know seem to not even consider that they’ll ever come across this 50% of the population? Do they think that conservatives are mythical creatures who show up to cast votes on Election Day then disappear for four years? It confuses me a lot. Is this just a vocal minority of people? Or do a lot of people just hate conservatives so much that they don’t care how it comes off? Genuinely curious to see what you guys have to say.

15,When does culture need to be changed?,"There’s always been a debate about how poverty is influenced by culture compared to how it is influenced by government.
I would argue that both play a significant role.Jim Crowe, red lining and slavery are undeniably major examples were government obviously had an effect on the financial status of black Americans.

But there is a lot of evidence to suggest cultural influences poverty as well. Blacks experience similar levels of poverty to Hispanics, but they have significantly worse arrest rates and crime rates. Hispanics also have significantly stronger family structures. They have better divorce rates, single parenthood rates, graduation rates, Child abuse rates. 

Whites also show evidence of cultural influence on outcomes. They have the highest per capita wealth, but they have the highest drug usage rates. 

I understand that the left is currently focusing on cultural change in white culture, specifically around racism. I think that it is a valid argument. I also recognize that there is a push to be more accepting of the results of cultures such a single parenthood. Though I doubt that that will actually prove effective on children’s outcomes, I don’t think that it is in an immoral stance.But some of these issues are no joke. Child abuse and violent crime is no joke. And It concerns me that on these issues the left is largely silent, Which I can only assume stems from the fear that it will somehow invalidate their push for cultural reforms for white racist cultures. 

When does culture need to be vocally addressed and changed? Or should we just accept all cultures as they are?

Maybe softer on guns? But I believe the country is trending leftward. The most definitive evidence I've seen is this survey conducted by the Public Religion Research Institute:  a previous (2016) poll asked respondents whether they believed that “God granted the United States a special role in human history.” Every time that question had been previously posed, most Americans answered Yes—in 2016, by a 57 percent to 40 percent margin.

50,What does a smart Liberal strategy look like for the next few years?,"The response I'm seeing on this sub that most resounds with me is that this was not an election about policy, but about identity and rhetoric. As many have brought up, Florida voted to increase the minimum wage. Freakin' Kentucky voted to pass Marcy's law, which was officially non-partisan but to me came across as a social justice move. And yet, despite doing things that look very liberal, the country still is widely voting for Trump and other Republican politicians.

I'm wondering if Liberals need to start working the next few years to change their rhetoric and strategy but not their policy. For instance, I don't think that the country has anything against tax funded public programs in general. But if you call it Socialism suddenly everyone flees in terror.

Okay, another example. Look at the comments on the Andrew Yang interviews on Fox News and The Daily Wire. A whole bunch of republicans saying ""wow he is so cool, I would vote for him over Biden."" Yang is arguably the most leftist of the 2020 candidates and he has republicans saying they would vote for him. Now these could be trolls. But I also wonder how well a Democratic politician would do if they could figure out how to talk to independents and Republicans in the right way.

I also think that a lot of the success that Trumpism is having comes as a result of calculated internet based strategy and propaganda.

So my question is, What strategy do we need to address the identity and rhetoric of Trumpism? Can we do it without sacrificing values? Does it require complex string pulling on social media? Grassroots door to door meetings?

54,Serious Question of the Day: I’m starting to feel this will be a Biden presidency with a McConnell controlled Senate... Am I right to believe that this is the ideal alternative for Republicans (assuming a Trump loss is inevitable)?,"So it’s looking like the senate will be broken down 51-49 with a Republican majority, cocaine-Mitch wiped the floor with his opponent so he’ll be the majority leader for a minimum of 2 years if the 51 holds.

Senate electoral math for 2022 favors republicans way way more than 2020 did (this was a shit year in terms of chances, far more Repub seats were up for election this year than Dem) so right now that Republican senate majority could feasibly be assumed for the entire 4 years of the first Biden term.

I can’t help but feel relieved by this, but let me explain.


My major premise here is that the 2020 senate election was the lynchpin of the next decade or so of American politics. It would be the deciding factor in packing the courts, confirming appointments, admitting new states, etc etc - all plans to cement Democratic power for several decades.

Well... that’s all presumably impossible now, right? So there’s a few things I want to note:

- Point 1.) The lid has completely been blown off of politicizing the court (don’t care who you blame for this, that’s the way it is now ergo it no longer matters) so that almost guarantees that no federal district/circuit courts or Supreme Court will have any Biden appointees confirmed while McConnell is in control of the senate.

TLDR - Biden might potentially be the first President in history to have all judicial nominees of any kind rejected. 

- Point 2.) The major ‘safety valve’ policy of the Democratic Party of balancing the court by adding new seats is a moot point in a 51-49 Republican majority. You’ll never convince even the squishiest Republican to flip on that. This effectively cements ACB’s power, and by extension the conservative 6-3 SCOTUS majority for a minimum of 2 years and likely 4 with the 2022 electoral map. Another major coup for Republicans considering this acts as a second layer of negation to any offensive (to the right) policy from the left. 

TLDR - 2 to 4 years of solid Conservative majority on SCOTUS means a *ton* of liberal priorities will be smothered in the crib. 

- Point 3.) Senate republicans weren’t punished electorally for forcing ACB onto the Court. Gardner (CO) was pretty much expected to be slaughtered but the rest of the races are showing a so-far comfortable hold by republicans on 51 seats (could change!) This incentivizes even more radical action on the part of Senate Republicans. 

TLDR - The senate republicans will be emboldened to act even crazier since there was no clear rebuke of their actions. 


- Point 4.) Hunter Biden is going to be the new Mueller Investigation, whether it’s a legitimate controversy (it is) or not.  At this point it’s a foregone conclusion that a Republican senate is going to be dragging every person that came within an inch of Biden’s family before committees. This will promote an easy narrative that Biden is corrupt, and may spark a potential impeachment and removal if republicans manage to get the House at some point in the next 2-6 years.  

TLDR - Senate will want revenge for impeachment, will be dragging Biden’s weird family history through the mud in full public view for at least 2 years.

56,"If this is what it takes to make an election close, what is it gonna take to have a solid win?","At this point, no matter which way you think the election will go, it's incredibly clear that it will be close. Biden still has a very clear path to victory, but he's neck and neck in 4 states where the difference is &lt;100k votes (in NV it's &lt;10k). But I think it's important to point out that this is occurring in some of the worst possible circumstances for Conservatives. COVID-19 has now killed &gt;230k Americans with cases once again surging all across the country, unemployment is officially at 7.9%, and both of those have been exacerbated Trump's leadership. And to top it off, the president less than a week ago publicly told the Senate to ignore both of these problems so they could confirm his supreme court justice instead. And this is not even mentioning all the other bad things that've happened this year.

So if this is what it takes to give us an election as close as this one, what will it take for us to give us the landslide we were all hoping for tonight?",AskALiberal,1604493130

The average height of Fortune 500 CEOs is 6'0:

Women are most likely to choose men 10 inches taller than them:

Europeans are tall because women prefer men that are tall:

Even if a short man earns &gt;$200,000 a year which is more than almost all doctors, he will still be seen as less attractive than an unemployed 6'2 man:

23,Do you think Trump was a ‘necessary evil’?,"A bit of pre-election pontificating....

Trump is ultra-conservative, populist and some would say authoritarian. He has handed super conservatives victories and designed the kinds of policies they’ve wanted and pushed for.

And it hasn’t really worked for them. The country is not in better shape now than it was four years ago, and super-conservatives are not really polling very popularly at the moment.

I don’t think Trump is necessarily ‘evil’ but his inability to care about polls or popularity, to paint every criticism of him and his administration as ‘fake news’ and his Republican controlled Senate (and for a while, the House) has implemented some of the major policy that conservatives have loudly and boisterously shouted about for a number of years.

It’s clear that there was some level of protest vote when Trump won. Protest against the Washington ‘establishment’ and backlash from flyover states that felt under-appreciated and ignored. Trump hasn’t really fixed any of those problems.

I don’t want to predict the election result, but the polling is good for Biden and support for Trump has never really increased (instead has fallen away) since he was elected.

Is/was Trump inevitable and necessary? 

To put it another way, had Hillary won in 2016, it’s possible or even probable that Trump would now be in a position where he would be looking at an easy majority, and without an out of control pandemic to cement Trump and Senate Republican’s utter incompetence, it seems like we wouldn’t have otherwise had an ‘exposing event’ where people could see just how bad these policies and this politicking is and Trump may have also easily gotten a second term.

Of course, far fewer people would have died, so that would have been much better no matter how you slice it.

https://joebiden.com/gunsafety/#

which, is where I'll be getting these quotes from, unless otherwise attributed. I'm going to do my best to work through his page without an entire amount of bias, but there's so many objective lies and misrepresentations on there, that it might 

&gt;In 2005, then-Senator Biden voted against the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, but gun manufacturers successfully lobbied Congress to secure its passage. This law protects these manufacturers from being held civilly liable for their products – a protection granted to no other industry.

Biden wants to repeal the PLCAA. OK, he wants to take them to court. But, not because of quality control issues, or anything the manufacturers could be responsible for, he wants to try and hold them accountable for criminal misuse of their products, akin to suing Ford or Chevy for DUIs committed in their vehicles. 

The PLCAA came about in the first place, in response to a Clinton-era quest for trying to sue firearms manufacturers into bankruptcy. 

&gt;Joe Biden will enact legislation to once again ban assault weapons. This time, the bans will be designed based on lessons learned from the 1994 bans. For example, the ban on assault weapons will be designed to prevent manufacturers from circumventing the law by making minor changes that don’t limit the weapon’s lethality.

Here's the main one. 

First of all, there's no coherent definition of an ""assault weapon"" that has to do with anything involving the function of the firearm itself. If you look at Dianne Feinstein's most recent [attempted gun ban](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/66/text), it's clear that AWBs target a vague, poorly-defined, ever-expanding class of ""assault weapons"", primarily with a list of cosmetic features (which, despite what Biden is quoted in saying above, in no way impact the ""lethality"" of the firearm) to try and ban as many modern semiautomatic firearms as possible. 

That runs afoul of, at a minimum, [DC vs Heller](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/07-290.ZS.html) and [Caetano vs Massachusetts](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/14-10078), which confirmed that 2A protects your individual right to arms ""in common use for lawful purposes, which absolutely includes things like ""a majority of modern firearms"". 

Further, ""high capacity"" magazine bans universally target anything &gt;10 rounds, encompasses most standard modern magazines for anything that's not a 1911, and are already being [struck down as illegal.](https://apnews.com/article/ap-top-news-u-s-supreme-court-california-courts-gun-politics-11a1e49886a3143f2db3fbf5b10c5069)

Now, he doesn't just want to stop at trying to ban those items: 

&gt;This will give individuals who now possess assault weapons or high-capacity magazines two options: sell the weapons to the government, or register them under the National Firearms Act.

This is Democrats admitting that they have a confiscation scheme, you just actually have to understand what they're talking about. 

The National Firearms Act (NFA) covers a few things already, namely automatic firearms (machine guns), ""destructive devices"" (think rocket launchers, tanks) and, ironically enough, actually gun safety devices: suppressors. 

Biden wants to retroactively expand the NFA to include the Democrat idea of ""assault weapons"" and ""high capacity"" magazines, which, as stated above, would encompass a majority of commmonly owned firearms and their standard capacity magazines. 

That becomes problematic - and frankly, go back to 1945, also likely against [Murdock vs Pennsylvania](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/319/105/) - when you realize that NFA registration comes with a $200 ~~fine~~ ""tax"" per item, which is something Democrats have supported [raising to $500](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/5103). 

That means, if I legally own 1 AR15 and 10 standard magazines for that AR15, that's now 11 new NFA items under Biden's plan. Now, I'd automatically be a felon just for owning them on Day 1 (NFA registration isn't instantaneous, it's usually in the ""several months"" range, and Biden wants millions upon millions of new NFA items all at once), since owning unregistered NFA items is a good way to get a 10 year prison sentence. 

But, let's say the ""legal gun owners are now felons for actually owning their own property"" part gets waived. In the above scenario, you're still looking at a minimum of a $2200 fine - $5500 if they get their way and that $200 tax becomes a $500 one. 

Anyways, but yeah. If legal gun owners can't pay those thousands of dollars in fees, then there's two options. Either continue to exercise the Second Amendment as you had been - and completely ignore this initiative, albeit you're now a felon for most of whatever firearms and virtually all of the magazines you now have - or submit to a mandatory ""buyback"", which for all intents and purposes is just confiscation with a gift card. 

And that's only a fraction of his webpage. 

My questions:

* Is he an acknowledged idiot on the this side of the house, in terms of guns? 

* Do people (obviously can't get a 100%, talking general-ish) actually understand what they're supporting here?

* Do people actively know it's likely against 2A, and they just don't give a shit? 

* What do you consider to be ""common sense"" gun control? 

* Do you consider fining legal gun owners - under threat of a glorified confiscation plan (AKA, objectively Biden's gun policy) - thousands of dollars in order to maintain possession of their property ""common sense"" gun control?",AskALiberal,1604350688

A lot of progressive causes are very much looking forward, seeing government spending as investment. Stopping climate change, education spending, government healthcare, etc. are not just moral positions, they are ones which could reasonably be expected to either prevent future costs or generate future economic activity far in excess of spending. 

This also seems to be a problem with the business crowd in general - there are so many examples of businesses gutting R&amp;D to save costs now, and then the company ends up obsolete in the future, or more commonly fucking over their workers to save money, and then they end up with high turnover and a less skilled workforce.

But, looking at how traffic has been blocked for many miles in some places or how violent some are getting, it is extremely intimidating to wonder if a cross country road trip is a good idea for an Indian American who has been confused to be black sometimes from 20 feet away.

The fact is even in normal times, the world is more dangerous to POC especially black people.

I currently have a Michigan state gun license, but I do not own a gun, and if I’m being honest, I’m not the best marksman. And I’m not super sure having a gun would help me be safer. The main problem is that her rental lease runs out by the 8th so I have to pick her up by then.

I don’t have the cash on hand to fly her out because I am also a working student (researcher and graduate student at UMich) but I think I may end having to ask friends for a little cash to fly her out of there.

Her position in Ann Arbor, MI starts in January.

For example: Election Day is on a Tuesday because in the mid-1800s it made sense to put it on that day. 

More than 150 years later, it is still on a Tuesday even though Saturday would be a far better day to hold an election. Why don’t we change it?

The number of justices on the Supreme Court fluctuated until 1869. Since then there have been 9. In 2020, it’s apparently a bad idea to expand the number of justices on the SC mostly because it’s been 9 for a set period of time.

Eliminating the filibuster is seen as bad because it’s always existed, even though the filibuster has already been almost entirely eliminated.

I don’t see why any of these examples needs to be controversial. Election Day changing to be a Saturday would mean that both conservatives and liberals would have greater access to vote.

Expanding the Supreme Court to, say, 12 and ensuring there’s an even split of conservative and liberal judges would mean a more rigorous, and more fair SC which can only be good for the country.

Eliminating the filibuster would benefit both sides of politics, as doing so elsewhere has benefitted both sides of politics at different times.

These companies have made trillions of dollars in profits off of technology advancements driven by the needs of the Defense Department and NASA for things like missile guidance systems and getting spacecraft from the Earth to the Moon and out to the solar system. 

Fast forward to 2020, the average smart phone consists almost entirely of components and features that were initially funded by the government and/or driven by government requirements. It is nearly impossible to imagine the modern world without the guiding hand of government.

94,Could someone explain the Biden 401k plan and what it means for different income level workers?,"So currently, anyone can contribute up to $19,500 of pretax income to their traditional 401k and it will not be taxed. Simple enough. I have tried reading more into the Biden 401k plan which would replace (change? I’m really not sure hence why I’m asking) the pretax deduction and make it a tax credit of 26%. It is clear that the current 401k tax credit helps the highest income earners the most as the dollars that are not being taxed would have been taxed at a higher rate than someone that is in a lower tax bracket. 

My question here is, how does the 26% tax credit work and how would this affect people at different income levels (for example, 40k a year, 80k a year, and 200k a year or whatever you feel is appropriate to explain the concept). Or, at what income level would you be hurt by this change if you were contributing the maximum before and continued to contribute the same amount? 

I know this is not certain to be passed, it definitely seems to be lower on the list of Biden’s proposed plans.

41,"Agree or Disagree: Trump's ""America First"" Policy has Created an Entirely New Meaning of Left v. Right in America.","Hello everyone! Trump supporter here to discuss the subject of Trump v. the Establishment-- and spread a unifying message 4 days before the election.

So, I recently watched a video titled ""[Why I'm Voting for Trump, and Why you Should too](https://youtu.be/3REI9QhaJGw)"" by conservative youtuber John Doyle. In this video, he attempts to make a bipartisan case for voting for Donald Trump. His main assertion is that Trump has taken the ""moral"" policies of 20th century Republicans and Democrats and formed them both into his ""America First"" plan. The breakdown looks like this; Democrat moral policies: Anti-wars, Main street, and pro working man. Republican moral policies: Low taxes, pro life, and law and order. Trump took these and put them into one platform, while opposing the ""immoral"" policies of both sides; Republican: Endless wars, wall street, military industrial complex. Democrats: illegal aliens, biased media, abortion advocacy.

Since the establishment of both sides had been pushing these respective platforms for 60+ years, Trumps platform upset the Democrats who saw Trump as roadblock in their path of progressivism that they had been pushing unopposed for decades, and the Republicans who had been collecting a paycheck while preaching ""freedom and guns"" for a century while letting our brothers, sisters, fathers, and sons die in the sand across the world for ""democracy.""  Therefore, both sides had to gear up to paint Trump as a racist, misogynistic, tyrannical sociopath in hopes to get him out in four years, so if he loses this election, they can immediately go back to the status quo of endless wars, hollowed out towns, pro-wall street progressivism that have been dominating the U.S. for a half century. They know Trump is creating a movement that, if allowed to go for four more years, will be too much opposition to their accelerationist agenda for them to handle.

Sorry for the rambling, but I'm sure you get the gist. What are your thoughts on this hypothesis? Is there anything you agree with? Disagree with?

57,SOS! In need of voting for Biden instead of not voting at all arguments help. I'm debating with a guy about Trump Vs Biden. I'm trying to make the case that voting for Biden is better than not voting as a protest vote against both candidates and that Biden is better than Trump.,"**The TL;DR of my debate:** 

He claims that you shouldn't vote for Biden or Trump because both candidates are corrupt. I say a vote for Biden is better than protesting the system and not voting. Can someone help debunk and critique his claims and explain why not voting is useless and why you should still vote for Biden. 

Really any videos, studies, articles and any information as well as a more detailed comparison between Trump and Biden would be helpful. Or as long and detailed posts as possible going through his arguments or help in constructing better counter arguments.

I believe he is partially wrong or misrepresenting the arguments but here are a summary of  his problems with voting Biden and the democrats:

1. Biden has a track record for being racist, Biden bragged about his relationship with black voters but he is personally responsible for jailing tens of thousands of black men just for possessing weed and various other petty/minor crimes also critiquing Kamala for her strict history on criminal justice and he claims Biden only chose Kamala as VP to virtue signal that he isn't racist anymore.

2. When it comes to helping black people then Trump is actually the better candidate, he got black unemployment down to its lowest point ever.

3. Biden has sex and rape allegations, which Kamala critiqued Biden for during the democratic debates but she has since ignored the allegations since becoming VP which makes her look like a hypocrite.

4. Biden is a terrible presidential candidate. You should never want to support Biden that is supporting corruption.

The whole democratic party needs to change and clean itself from all its corruption and you never get that if you support them.

5. The Obama Administration and Biden allowed killing of innocent civilians, unjustified wars with stealing of resources and torture in their foreign policy, Guantanamo Bay, drone strikes the wars etc.

The Trump Admin. has not tortured people like under The Obama Admin. Obama tried to create war between the US and North Korea but Trump stopped it. Obama's people are war hungry but Trump's people are not because they didnt start a new war. Trump has a much

more diplomatic and peaceful approach to foreign policy with not as many deaths under his belt as Obama and Biden.

6. Why should you want the democrats to come back to power again so they can go back to playing world police, killing innocent people and stealing their resources? And Trump removed almost everything Obama did so now you want to remove everything Trump did?

7. Biden overall could have done a better job as VP the 8 years he was in the white house why didn't Biden and Obama do all the things they say they were going to do.

Why should you trust them when they have a bigger rhetorical track record for their policies and programs than actually doing something building trust with voters by creating a resume of accomplishments. Biden shouldn’t be elected because he has a bad political resume/CV.

8. The guy i'm debating believes Amy Coney Barrett is a fantastic supreme court judge pick, she is objective, as she is focused on what the law says, she's strict in mixing her own opinion in her job, something that is good since that would be breaking the law otherwise.

9. Biden made fun of Trump for limiting travel to the Usa from China when Covid came Trump did to a better job with Covid than Obama and Biden did with the swine flu, and Biden Nancy Peolosi and the gang has worked against Trump when he is trying to help the american people.

10. Biden believes Antifa is an idea not an organization and if he won’t critique the left why should Trump critique the right when it comes to condoning the violence and rioting more specifically in the first debate between them.

The left is commiting crime, rioting and protesting more violently and to a much larger degree than the right and it's mostly BLM and Antifa that are the problem and they should both be labeled terrorist organizations. And their political violence is never justified.

**A rough documentation of our conversation:**

He begins with Biden made fun of Trump for limiting travel to the Usa from China when Covid came 

Biden bragged about his relationship with black voters but he’s personally responsible for jailing tens of thousands of black men just for possessing weed and various other petty/minor crimes.

He also criticized Biden for picking Kamala as VP just to virtue signal that he isn’t racist even though he has been exposed for saying racist things a lot of times, and has been involved in corruption and unjustified war and Biden overall could do a better job as VP they 8 years he was in the white house.

He says his point is that both Trump and Biden are awful presidential candidates, one could critique and build up a case against Biden just like with Trump, so why should you obsess and worry so much about Trump being the bad guy when Biden is not an angel? In comparison Biden got blood on his hands as well.

He can admit that Biden is better than Trump but that doesn't mean that Biden is good, Biden is a horrible presidential candidate and the american people deserve someone much better than both of them.

He says he just isn't a fan of someone killing innocent people for resources referencing the Obama admin foreign policy.

Biden shouldn’t be elected because he has a bad resume/CV

He says you could come up with Biden’s 3-5 worst cases and make him look like shit

just as you could with Trump.

I tried to argue that a vote for Biden is also a vote for getting more democrats in various

positions into The White House and The Senate and beyond. And Biden will most likely bring back The Obama Admin. regulations and policies which Trump has deregulated or removed so if nothing else Biden can at least bring back things to they way they were under The Obama Admin.

He responds with why do you want to see the democrats come back to power again so they can go back to playing world police killing innocent people and stealing their resources? And Trump removed everything Obama did so now you want to remove everything Trump did?

I said Obama managed to secure an Iran nuclear deal and that Trump has drastically increased the sale of weapons, as well as increasing the amount of drone strikes and making it harder for CIA and others to count and make stats of people killed in drone attacks.

He responds that Obama tried to create war between the US and North Korea but Trump stopped it. 

He says that Obama's people are war hungry but Trump's people are not because they didnt start a new war. 

He continues by citing the rape and sex allegations against Biden and calls Kamala a hypocrite for supporting him when she also argued for the Biden allegations being true during the democratic debates. 

He says the fact that Kamala managed to work for that rapist Biden is weird and he doesn't understand why im tricked into supporting Biden and kamala.

I try to respond with at least Biden releases his tax returns and doesn't cut in the social security budget but he says it doesn't help a rapist for president? No thank you.

I say but hasn't Trump sex allegations against him as well i care more about voting for the policies than voting for the person.

He responds with but that's impossible for they are both liars in terms of policies not only that but let’s base this on their resumes if you are voting for Biden you are voting for torture and war so why vote for Biden i don’t know about you but im 100% agaist war and torture not only war but if you care about the black community then Biden is the last guy you should vote for based on their resume. When it comes to helping black people then Trump is actually the better candidate, he got black unemployment down to its lowest point ever.

I respond with the trend in the black unemployment numbers going down started under The Obama Admin., But the african american household growth has slowed down under Trump.

He responds with nope, this is your problem you have a clear bias so you find stuff that correlates with your worldview.

He says these facts you're coming  with could be true or total bullshit. We all know that 90% of what the media writes is lies. You are on purpose searching for things that makes Trump look bad and Biden look good, why can't you stick to Biden’s resume rape allegations, war, torture, racism that he has been involved in for decades. Can you see all this and still claim he is a good guy?

He continues my point is that Trump is not a good guy i have never said that, my point is that Biden is also a bad guy because of his resume therefore fuck them both is all i’m saying, but you can’t because you want to belive that biden is a good guy and you love to hate trump but you gain nothing from it.

I respond with but there are still differences between Trump and Biden in their party program. Yes, Obama may have deported more people than Trump, but it was with a higher standard for people with criminal records than Trump.

He responds that is not true and Trump has not tortured people like under Obama.

I say 4 years with Biden a better candidate than Trump is better than not voting, and Biden is not gonna potentially nominate anti aboriton supreme court judges.

He responds with defending Trump’s choice of Amy Coney Barrett, Anti abortion supreme court judge? No please don't tell me you eat up everything CNN writes do you?

Have you even heard the hearings with her lately?

I have, she is a fantastic supreme court judge pick, she is objective, as she is focused on what the law says, she's strict about not mixing her own opinion into her job, something that is good since that would be breaking the law or being biased otherwise.

I then say so why not vote for the candidate that works in collaboration with the Bernie team on the environment and climate policy?

He then responds with because Biden is a terrible presidential candidate i don’t want any more war and torture as simple as that, i never want to support Biden that is supporting coruption.

The whole democrat party needs to change and clean itself from all its corruption and you never get that if you support them.

I respond with but you think it's okay with Trump escalating the sale of guns to Saudi Arabia and supporting them even after they kill journalists?

He responds by comparing Obama’s foreign policy deaths by saying 10.000 lives vs 1 journalist?

I don't want to see life get lost but one life lost  vs thousands of lives is not a hard choice.

I respond with what about Trump's handling of Covid when we talk about saving lives, why say no to sending out masks to people?

He responds well Trump did to a better job with Covid than Obama and Biden did with The Swine Flu, and Biden, Nancy Pelosi and the gang has worked against Trump when he is trying to help the american people, if that doesn’t show that the democrats don’t give a fuck about the people then i don’t know.

Then the conversation stopped and i started wondering how to respond and convince him to support Biden and be more critical about Trump. I’m open for any help, debunking, more information, rebuttals and arguments thanks for reading and helping me out and thanks for your time.

&amp;#x200B;

**Responses and counter arguments:**

The guy i'm talking to wrote a response on Facebook Messenger to the opening debunking of his argument in the comments of the original post here it is: 

But it might just be that he feels a lot of media and news are left leaning as well as culture in general and have a bias in being soft on critiquing the left while at the same time being as hard towards the right as possible while right leaning media does the same just the other way around, and if they both were more honest his and many others trust would be restored more in reporting, journalism and news.

The guy i'm talking to doesn't have a Reddit account or at least one old enough with enough karma to post and he didn't have time to do a full counter argument of your entire post but he did write one for the opening: 

Sadboi (a guy in the comments of the original post who debunked some of his arguments) has alternatives here, let me answer all 3:

1. Just because Trump is possibly a racist doesn't make Biden any less racist.

2. I can understand the mindset that if Trump gets support from white nationalism and Biden doesn't, then you can start to wonder why, but again the fact that Trump is potentially racist doesn't mean that Biden is any less racist himself, the whole point about this argument is to debunk or counter argue that Biden isn't racist, right?, So far that hasn't been done.

3. He says you can't vote on a politician's past, but what you believe they will do in the future, yes, ok point there. But I believe you absolutely should judge and take their past into consideration? That's all i'm saying, the past needs to be taken into consideration.",AskALiberal,1604083358

72,Questions on COVID-19/media/Harris/BLM. Thanks 🙏,"I was directed here by some top quality redditors over at r/centrist. I tend to lean towards the centre on most issues. As was rightly pointed out to me, Biden is the more centrist candidate, yet, I plan on voting for Trump. Frankly I have found any attempt at discussion has generally resulted in me being shut down and/or censored. Without being able to even have dialogue how can concerns be alleviated! 

Get out and vote but whatever happens, I hope everyone can try and get along. Focus energy towards things one can change etc etc. The world didn’t end in 2016 and I’m 99% certain it won’t end in 2020.

My main concern is the democrats who surround Biden. Or seem to have the most support by democrat voters. With that in mind I’ll ask my questions.

1) Covid-19. It’s bad. Globally a catastrophe. Excluding my views on the scale and accuracy of the data from less advanced countries, the US has had a lot of deaths. Currently 234k. A staggering number. I am pro wearing masks and socially distancing where possible. 

a) Do you support going into a lockdown? 

b) How do you feel the economy will be affected? 

c) current death rate is 706 per million people. What number would constitute 0 lockdown? 

2) I find the media inherently biased. Right wing bias exists but without searching for it I generally come across media that’s.. anti-right. Selective editing and I hate to say it but fake news.. have made me wary of many anti-right messages. (I hope it’s clear I am not meaning nazi’s. I am against all forms of facism.)

a) do you feel that the way trump has been attacked by the media since he ran for office is just? 

b) if Trump were to win how would you view those who’ve been providing the news? 

3. Harris.

a) what is the main reason you support Harris?

b) do you think she has helped or hindered the campaign? 

4. BLM. See my point above about the media. Black lives matter. I’m 100% in support of the fact that black lives matter. The organisation however, lacks transparency and demonstrations are being hijacked. Stuff is actively being suppressed. Loss of life is wrong. That said in 95% of the videos I have eventually seen of police shootings, I have sided with the police. 

a) please give me a name and supporting evidence of a recent shooting (since the protests started) where you felt the police were at fault? 

b) what is your view on the damage/looting?

c) if you have been to a protest that turned bad, did you notice opposition to anyone ‘recording’? What’s your view on this? 

5. Lastly. If Trump wins, what will you do in the weeks following?

Maybe I'll be pleasantly surprised. But I'm wondering what high level politicians do you see as being presidential material in 2024?

It seems to me that except for Biden, all of the Democrat candidates this election were just not up to the task of taking down Trump. It seems like the moderates were not well known or respected nationally, like Buttigieg, and the well known candidates like Sanders were just too controversial and ""radical left"" to make it. Biden had the status of being the former vice president and the association with Obama, along with being politically moderate enough to be palpable for the right wing of the party. Even for Biden, though, it appears that America is more interested in him as an alternative to Trump than for his policies. He just doesn't have the enthusiasm behind him that Obama did.

Personally, when I see Biden speak I'm rooting for him, and also hoping he won't slip up too much. Whenever I watch Obama speak I'm just floored.

I'm wondering if there are any democratic politicians right now that would be electable enough to make it in 2024 -- someone who is moderate but fiery like Obama, who can get the country excited about them. And who is well known enough that by 2024 they could enter the national spotlight.

93,What is the difference between a Social Democrat and a Democratic Socialist?,"Hello,

&amp;#x200B;

This is a two-parter question. First, I'm curious as to the difference I am asking about. Second, I am trying to clarify the difference because I am trying to figure out what label to put on myself. I have considered myself left-center for a while now and a liberal in general. However, I wanna be more specific. I think I'd probably be a social democrat but I'm not sure if that label is correct, hence the question. Here is a general outline:

1. I believe in competitive markets as an engine of prosperity (keyword COMPETITIVE, we need anti-trust legislation and the like).
2. I believe the best kind of market would be one where privately owned firms compete with worker owned firms. This balances incentives basically. The incentive of leaders of a worker collective is to win the votes of workers. They do this by bettering their circumstances, pay, vacation days, etc. However, they also need to balance the needs of the firm, and the firm relies on the customer. They need to balance the needs of the customer and worker. The privately owned firms must compete with the worker collectives (which by definition are focused on their workers) to get workers. So they also have to treat workers well otherwise they go to the worker collectives. Worker collectives must treat customers well or they will go to private companies. This only works in a competitive market however, and competition can decline over time cause of consolidation, hence you rely on anti-trust legislation.
3. Entrepreneurship is a very good thing. We can foster it through good welfare policies, because it reduces the risk of leaving your job and gives your employer less hold over you.
4. Seizing the board on behalf of workers isn't necessarily a good idea, cause it can screw over entrepreneurs and the like. It would be much better to force them to compete against worker collectives.
5. Democracy is good.

&amp;#x200B;

Tough on illegal immigration doesn't seem to be a big thing on the campaign this time compared to last time. He brings up those other things a lot more. anti illegal immigrant was a huge thing in 2016

65,Question about how Universal Healthcare should work,"I’m for Universal Healthcare. But when it comes to some details, I haven’t made up my mind on how it should ideally work. Thought I’d ask here.


Taking a specific example - insulin for diabetics. There are older human versions that cost $100+ and there are newer human analog versions that cost $300+. The former may need to be administered multiple times a day whereas the latter may only need to be administered once a day. Then there are differences in equipment - like older vials vs newer pens.


So, assuming there is Universal Healthcare that’s administered by the Government, my sequence of questions are as follows:


1. Are we ok with leaving it to the Govt to decide which version of insulin should be provided? What if the Govt’s “health experts” decide that the older version is sufficient and should be what’s provided as part of universal healthcare? Would we be ok with that?
2. Assuming, the Govt does decide that the older version is sufficient, should it be possible for individuals to pay out of pocket for additional insurance to get the newer version? If so, would the subsequent creation of “two classes of people” under universal healthcare - one of which can afford the newer version of insulin - be acceptable?",AskALiberal,1603835542

His tariff threats forced Mexico to crack down on illegal immigration. Mexico is for the first time in recent history enforcing its own immigration laws — sending thousands of National Guard forces to its southern border to stop caravans of Central American migrants.

Trump signed the biggest wilderness protection &amp; conservation bill in a decade and designated 375,000 acres as protected land.

McConnell, like any opposition party leader, took every opportunity to stymie the President. While others in the Republican party privately worried that appearing too obstructionist as America dug its way out of a financial crisis might come off as callous, McConnell knew something that the rest of us didn't.

As a result of his keeping a finger on the pulse of the American electorate and of an understanding of politics like few Senators have ever had, McConnell knew that, not only would he face zero cost for digging in his heels against Obama, but rather that he would be *rewarded* for standing in the way of anything with that president's fingerprints on it.

Finally, in early 2016, he set into motion his magnum opus. With an open Supreme Court seat and a Presidential choice to fill it,  McConnell convinced all of America that confirming a justice nine months before an election would be anti-Democratic and an insult to voters across the country. Of course, the line was parroted by other Republicans and the public, but I imagine that even McConnell was surprised when the entire media began repeating it as though it were Gospel.

And today, the climax: McConnell is almost personally responsible for a conservative interpretation of the Constitution that will last for generations. And with 60 million votes already cast, few people that matter -- the last few undecided or persuadable voters -- know or care what happened to Obama and Garland.

4,Recommended Further Reading Regarding Originalist Judicial Philosophy?,"Hey everyone, I come in good faith and am really just looking for suggestions, not to have an argument. 

So with the confirmation of Barrett tonight, I'm curious if you all could recommend some sources you're familiar with that take a critical approach to originalist judicial philosophy in a serious manner (i.e. something beyond ""well, if we only did originalism then we wouldn't have \_\_\_\_"" when, of course, originalism doesn't say you *shouldn't* have \_\_\_\_\_, but rather that it's not included within the context of the Constitution and that it should be decided via the appropriate channels). 

I know there are plenty of people who aren't happy about Barrett's confirmation for political reasons or concerns about the implications of how she's likely to rule in certain cases, but I'm curious about the actual issues people take with the philosophy itself. And I know not all liberals take issue with originalism, but this is for the ones who do specifically, or who are just interested in the topic. 

I recently read ""[The Jurisprudence of Antonin Scalia: A Critical Appraisal](https://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2130&amp;context=faculty_scholarship)"" by Chemerinsky, but I found it less than convincing, to say the least. (Thank you to whoever it was from over here who posted it to r/AskConservatives, by the way, I enjoyed the read.) 

I'm certainly not married to the idea of originalism and don't consider it to be infallible, but so far it seems like the least dangerous and most logical philosophy to implement in my mind, which seems quite fitting to me for the ""least dangerous branch."" 

Ideally, I'd love to see if you all could share some arguments you've read that aren't just critiques of originalism, but explicitly argue why \_\_\_\_\_ judicial philosophy makes more sense.

Growing up, politicians from both sides of the isle were always viewed as dishonest, and before trump most people really dont know who represents their state. 2016 really brought the inner workings of our government to light and all the back door dealings are now general public knowledge. I think the boomer generation sides with him because he's a complete fucking asshole to everyone in Washington to reinforce the ""never trust a politician"" rederick. This in turn gave republicans and democrats a sort of reality check.

Now with covid this was all kicked into overdrive, trump is aiming his madness at local politicians and their failings.

On to why i think he could win again.. Durring the second debate trump made it known he wants to reopen and dam the consequences. And Biden wants to impose federal mask mandates and possibly more shutdowns.
I think a majority of Americans dont like being told what to do, and I personally would like less power to the police to do that, including arresting those for not wearing a mask or not quarantining.

81,How Do You Combat The Right Wing Talking Point That California Is Horrible And Texas Is Much Better?,"Also I will tell you how I do it. First of all I correct people that leave California because it’s a crime filled, poor place, it because of housing costs! For example, In Los Angles the average home cost is 768K dollars according to [Zillow](https://www.zillow.com/los-angeles-ca/home-values/).  And the average rent for a one bedroom apartment is 2402 dollars according to [Rent Jungle ](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.rentjungle.com/average-rent-in-los-angeles-rent-trends/amp).  Now let’s compare this to Houston... In Houston the average home value is 196K dollars according to [Zillow](https://www.zillow.com/houston-tx/home-values/) once again. And the average rent for a one bedroom apartment is 1183 dollars according to [Rent Jungle](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.rentjungle.com/average-rent-in-houston-rent-trends/amp). 

Then after I debunk thier first claim, Conservatives will pivot to the, Texas has lower poverty and unemployment rates than California and ranks higher in other categories. This of course is not true! It is true that California does have a higher poverty rate, but it’s important to remember that 1. Housing costs a lot there and 2. It has ten more million people than Texas. Yes California does did have a higher unemployment rate at [4% ](https://www.statista.com/statistics/189394/unemployment-rate-in-california-since-1992/) in 2019. But that is only 0.6% higher than Texas’s rate, witch was [3.4%](https://www.twc.texas.gov/news/historic-low-continues-october-2019-texas-adds-fifth-month-record-low-unemployment)in 2019. 
And of course Texas ranks lower in most categories. On [US News List for best states ](https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/rankings), California ranked 19th overall. It ranked 7th in health care, 21 in education, 4th in economy, 32 in infrastructure, 42 in Fiscal Stability, 23 In Crime and Corrections and 5th in natural environment, and 49 in opertunity. Texas ranked 38th overall. And they ranked... 37th in healthcare, 34th in education, 15th in economy, 33 in infrastructure 39 in opertunity, 12 in fiscal stability, 33 in crime and corrections and 40th in natural environment.

&gt;While older Black voters look as if they’ll vote for Biden by margins similar to Clinton’s in 2016, Trump’s support among young Black voters (18 to 44) has jumped from around 10 percent in 2016 to 21 percent in UCLA Nationscape’s polling. Black voters remain an overwhelmingly Democratic-leaning constituency, but a notable reduction in their support could still be a problem for Biden. 

&gt; Notably, young Black voters don’t seem to feel as negatively about Trump as older Black Americans do. For instance, an early-July African American Research Collaborative poll of battleground states found that 35 percent of 18-to-29-year-old Black adults agreed that although they didn’t always like Trump’s policies, they liked his strong demeanor and defiance of the establishment. Conversely, just 10 percent of those 60 and older said the same.

Disturbingly, the same thing was found with Latino voters:

&gt; It’s a similar story with younger Hispanic Americans, a group where Trump has also made gains. According to UCLA Nationscape’s polling, Trump is attracting 35 percent of Hispanic voters under age 45, up from the 22 percent who backed him four years ago in the CCES data.

&gt; Most notably, even though Trump stands to gain with nonwhite voters across the board, his support seems to have risen the most among Hispanic voters with a four-year college degree. We don’t want to overstate the influence of this group — they make up about 2 percent of the population age 25 and older nationwide — but they are disproportionately concentrated in one especially vital swing state: Florida. 

&gt; One last point on where Trump has made gains among Black and Hispanic voters: He has done particularly well with Black and Hispanic men, which might speak to how his campaign has actively courted them.


There’s also [this CNN article,](https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/23/politics/trump-least-racist-black-men/index.html) which alleges the same rise in support.


Personally as a black man, this development deeply confounds me. If it is true that is. After all, it’s only a couple polls.

87,What would the dynamics and factions of a perpetually governing Democratic Party be like?,"[From The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/06/republicans-2024-nominee-will-be-trump-acolyte/612925/):

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The contraction of the GOP coalition is why Madrid believes that the party may be locked into a cycle in which it grows only more strident. Starting in the early 2000s, as California became more and more diverse, the state GOP became more and more uncompetitive. In response, white conservatives there rejected calls to broaden their message and instead doubled down on hard-line positions on immigration, guns, and abortion, among other issues. He says the national GOP may be on the same trajectory—committing more heavily to a Trumpian message of white racial identity as even more voters who came to the party for other reasons (like cutting taxes) drift away. **“The Republican Party could become the National Front in France,” with support from a “hard floor and a hard ceiling” of about one-third of the country**, Madrid says. 

&amp;#x200B;

In this scenario, it's apparent that the GOP wouldn't be much different than it is nowadays. Aside from the fact that it only gets 30% of the vote each election.

But if [the electoral map looks similar to this](https://images.dailykos.com/images/831947/story_image/2028electoralmap.jpg?1594792363) every time, that would mean the only political party that matter would be the Dems.

88,What are the movies that best illustrate liberal beliefs?,"To me, Dallas Buyers Club and The 400 Blows.

Dallas Buyers Club is about a Texan man that is diagnosed with HIV in the 80s, a time when the disease was severely misunderstood and heavily stigmatized. Not having alot of options for treatment, he resorted to working with a transgender person and smuggling FDA-unapproved drugs from Mexico to sell it at a premium in the US. Along the way he finds empathy and respect for people LGBT people and making money became less of a concern, instead focusing on helping people.  


400 Blows is about a troubled kid growing up in Paris during the 1950s. His rebelliousness, truancy and disciplinary problems are framed in the context of his relationship to his parents and his teacher: his parents are constantly fighting and misunderstand him, and his teacher is a strict and gives-no-quarter. Overtime he gets into worse and worse trouble which culiminates with him getting caught trying to steal hisis father's typewriter at work and being sent to a juvenile detention center. To me, it shows that the primary motivations of a person's actions is the circumstances they find themselves in.

At the last debate, Trump said easily debunkable lies (the one I most vividly remember is him saying that a public health insurance option means abolish private health insurance). This is obviously a lie, and it's easily disproven by googling it.

When it comes to American conservative talk radio, it relies entirely on emotional appeal. Sean Hannity's entire show is basically just him repeating the line ""Biden is a puppet of the radical left and hides in his basement. He should be called Bunker Biden."". Which works great if you're a 40 or 50 something that came of age under Reagan, but not to younger people.

Contrast this to the right wing of other countries. From my very limited knowledge, their parties have LGBT wings and their pundits seem to rely more on misleading arguments than purely emotional appeals (compare someone like Jordan Peterson to someone like Sean Hannity). But maybe I'm wrong.

However, I feel like past iterations of American conservatism tried being more logical. Reagan's wikipedia page shows him using a (probably misleading) chart to help support his economic plan. Bush's first campaign was about ""compassionate conservatism"", which had a whole argument behind it.

Has the Supreme Court become too enmeshed with politics?,"I am a European and intermittently follow political developments in the US. Of course the nomination of Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court is making headlines now. One of the things that has always puzzled me is how pivotal the Supreme Court seems to be in American politics. Looking at Supreme Court nominations and the intense partisan debate it engenders sometimes gives me the feeling that the prospective Justices are running for office, not unlike people campaigning in elections. Except that a Supreme Court Justice is not an elected position. In Europe there are several insitutions comparably to the Supreme Court, such as the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany, but I doubt anyone knows who is on the bench.

Then there is the role of the Supreme Court when it comes to laws. To me it seems that the Supreme Court does not merely interpret laws in light of the Constitution, but *de facto* makes laws as well. The legality of abortion depends on whether Roe vs. Wade is upheld or not. Same-sex marriage is legal throughout the United States because of a decision of the Supreme Court. Perhaps I don't know enough about US politics but I can't remember either issue ever being decided by Congress debating and enacting a law. I know Congress still enacts laws, such as the Patriot Act or the Affordable Care Act, but it seems to me that the Supreme Court increasingly takes on the role of legislator as Congress becomes paralysed by partisan obstruction. And that Supreme Court nominations turn into political battles between Democrats and Republicans for that reason.

I know this sub loves evidence-based policy, however it’s unclear how Biden will a) deal with the non-emission impacts of fracking or b) “capture” all emissions from fracking in 5 years.

I think, practically speaking, (American) conservatism is insane (see Trump and the vast majority of the GOP these days). Just about the only opinion I agree with the Republican Party on is that I'm pro-nuclear (although many on the left are as well, plus I haven't seen Republicans bring this up in a long time), primarily as a stopgap to radically reduce CO2 emissions by reducing coal power while we simultaneously transition our infrastructure to solar, wind, etc., so it's for different reasons than conservatives have for being pro-nuclear. It's becoming a moot point economically speaking, as solar and other forms of alternative energy are becoming cheaper by the day, but talking to some of my electrical engineering friends, my understanding is that our power grid needs a lot of work before it could be integrated on large scales with solar and wind power, while nuclear energy integrates seamlessly into our current infrastructure. All that being said, I want to think about conservatism more abstractly and look at the principles that conservatives' tend to espouse (even if they are awful at living in accordance to those principles in practice); I can't help but wonder what, if anything, we can learn from conservatism (the idea). For example, it seems like emphasis on individual responsibility is a generally good principle to aspire to live by, with the caveat that (obviously) it's okay to ask for help when you need it and it's important to help others in need when you're able to do so. Another idea that seems good to me is the emphasis on the importance of community. Those are a few of the ideas I've pondered, but when I look at reality, I can't help but notice that, ironically, liberals seem generally better at individual responsibility and supporting their communities than conservatives are in practice, because it seems like conservatives have taken their idea about individual responsibility to the extreme to the point where they are more interested in being selfish than supporting their communities.

Before COVID (and even now), the conservative and pro-trump crowd, often cited Trump as someone who kept his promises, and has helped the economy. Having worked in the fossil fuel industry, I have not seen the economy get better. I've seen things get worse, and I don't think he is worthy of this job. And most studies don't seem to agree.

There are some parallels between Grassley and Feinstein in the here and now which has me wondering the endgame for both.

1. Their longtime ""other"" senator who was younger than them (Tom Harkin, Barbara Boxer) retired with their replacements new to Washington (Joni Ernst, Kamala)
2. Because of this, the 1933-born senator feared that if they retired now ""that their state would lose power and influence in the Senate."" For Feinstein, add the ""do you want two new senators when we need experience to resist?""
3. Both Senators, who might have retired had (Harkin/Boxer) not, run for another term because of this fear that (Iowa/California) would fall into Senate oblivion. Grassley wins handily against...checks Wiki...a Patty Judge who won one county. Feinstein beats a Kevin DeLeon that even the California Dems wanted over her because of age concerns.
4. In their current term, the old age starts to show as well as the miscues. Grassley's conduct over the Kavanaugh hearings and general old man tweets like why the History Channel doesn't show history. Feinstein chiding schoolkids over the Green New Deal, insider trading, and hugging Lindsey Graham over how the ACB hearings were the ""best ever.""
5. Lo and behold, there is a fair chance that the ""new senator"" won't make it to the next Congress. One due to statements that angered the electorate, the other for bigger and brighter things.
6. Grassley turns 89 two months before Election Day 2020. Feinstein turns 91 five months before Election Day 2024. 

Both Grassley and Feinstein ran for another term because of the fear that having two new senators would hurt their states; people in New York or Massachusetts will deny that this is the case given how they recovered after. However, is there any off-ramp for them short of death or being begged to retire? At least if you retire, you can impart your knowledge to your replacement, you can't do that if you're dead.

But that isn't an option for the lower-48 tribes.

22,"Why, Exactly, did Beau Biden receive the bronze star and legion of merit?","I am wondering how the VP's son managed to get into Walter Reed while not on active duty and how he ended up with the Bronze Star let alone the Legion of Merit upon his death.

*For the final few years of his life, Biden suffered from brain cancer. On May 20, 2015, he was admitted to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, because of a recurrence of brain cancer; he died there 10 days later.*

I empathize his death and applaud his service but...

*Biden joined the military in 2003 as a member of the Delaware Army National Guard and was a Major in the Judge Advocate General (JAG) Corps as part of the 261st Signal Brigade in Smyrna, Delaware. Biden received a visit at Camp Victory from his father on July 4, 2009. Biden returned from Iraq in September 2009, his yearlong stint on active duty complete. Biden had announced that during his deployment he would continue to actively serve as Delaware's Attorney General by working in conjunction with his office's senior staff in Delaware. During his year of service in Iraq, Beau returned home only once — to see his father take the oath of office for vice president. Beau received the Bronze Star for his service, a military medal that celebrates “heroic or meritorious achievement.” The act justifying award of the medal must be performed while fighting an enemy of the United States, or while involved in conflict with an opposing/foreign force. It can also be awarded for heroism while serving with friendly forces engaged in combat against an opposing military in which the United States is not a belligerent party.*

Bronze star is supposed to be for heroism, not for just showing up. Also he was a lawyer.

*Army Chief of Staff Raymond Odierno presented Beau Biden with the Legion of Merit for his service in the Delaware National Guard. Odierno, Beau Biden’s commanding general in Iraq, also lauded his comrade’s military service overseas. The general presented Beau Biden with the Legion of Merit for his service in the Delaware National Guard. The award honors exceptional merit in the performance of outstanding services and achievements.*

Is there something I am missing here? What did Beau Biden do that was so meritorious? When did he go above and beyond the call of duty during his services as a lawyer in the signal corp (communications)? There has to be a story behind this.",AskALiberal,1603277939

*"" The poll found that slightly less than half of all Catholics (47%) approve of President Trump’s job performance. This marks a small improvement in his approval rate, which was 44% in November 2019. Likewise, about one-third (34%) of Catholics say they will definitely vote to re-elect President Trump""*

 *""These positive numbers for President Trump depend heavily on the devout Catholics. Among this group, 63% approve of the president. Similarly, 59% of devout Catholics plan to vote for Trump in 2020""*

Keep in mind this is almost exactly four years to the day of Comey's infamous Oct. 28 reopening of the Clinton investigation that almost certainly [is the reason we have Trump as president](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-comey-letter-probably-cost-clinton-the-election/).

The FBI, despite often being mistaken as an entity that holds Trump accountable, is overwhelmingly Republican and has never had a permanent director who was *not* a lifelong Republican.  It has a long history of purporting to follow the rules when investigating Republicans, and leaking all over when investigating Democrats.  So here we go again.

Make no mistake: the above story, if true, only could've come about if an FBI employee selectively leaked information with the goal of helping Trump win.  Note that the information is all anti-Biden, even if not surprising - there is a laptop and it's ""not part of a Russian disinformation campaign targeting Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden"" (which seems odd for them to be so certain about if they're not even sure if it's Hunter Biden's).  Meanwhile, the FBI officially refuses to say anything about it.  In other words, they leaked only what Trump wanted them to leak. This demonstrates that there's one or more FBI agents who is determined to make Trump win.  So there's probably going to be more FBI leaks to right wing sources with selective information intended to make Biden look bad, and possibly even publicly opening a Biden-related investigation on election eve as happened four years ago.

I was thinking Congress could agree that each new president (not each election, but actual new president), starting in 2020, assign 4 new justices until we get to 29 (or some high number) at some point in the future, which allows us time to prepare a building for such a thing.

78,How do we defeat NIMBYism and sprawl?,"So whatever happens at the federal level in 2020, blue states and cities are still going to be stuck with a housing crisis and gridlock within the democratic coalition itself over what to do about it. At least for this voter, in state and local races, I'm pretty much a single issue voter on housing (there's not much daylight between democrats in my area on other issues, and the housing crisis is all consuming).

I'm in CA and I see things like Oregon HB 2001 or the Minneapolis 2040 plan and I get a little envious. Here our most ambitious upzoning bill SB 50 failed for a third time earlier this year in a state senate vote. There's been other bills tweaking around the edges but nothing serious, with covid diverting all the attention in Sacramento. Newsom is making almost no progress towards his goal of millions of new residences over the next 5 years. Last I checked we were averaging just 80k units constructed per year across the entire state.

The situation in CA as I see it is that the opposition to SB 50 is coming largely from NIMBY homeowners who want to preserve their single family sprawls at all costs, keeping the dirty riff raff out (ofc this being CA they don't like to say that part out loud), and PHIMBY (public housing) advocates largely composed of low income, usually minority, renters who are terrified of high income renters displacing them.

PHIMBYs want density and construction but they want subsidized, affordable housing. In CA NIMBYs of course will never admit to being NIMBYs and will pretend to support hypothetical public housing disingenuously, along with other transparently bullshit objections. Unlike sincere PHIMBYs, they will of course fight actual, non-hypothetical public housing developments. Some PHIMBYs have effectively allied with or fallen for NIMBYs, though they have zero chance of ever getting the funding they want for mass social housing. Newsom vetoed AB 5, which was a drop the bucket, over budgetary concerns. Even if the funding came through NIMBYs will turn on the poor in a second and do everything they can to block actual construction.

YIMBYs who support any and all construction haven't done themselves any favors either, by lumping poor tenants in with rich homeowners and attacking poorer tenant groups calling them NIMBYs among other things. You'd think renters of different income levels should be able to form a pro-housing united front, but the well is pretty poisoned at this point. Some of these local tenant groups now reject ALL market-rate development. YIMBYs have tried to be more accommodating in the last couple of years, and some PHIMBY groups have come around to supporting SB 50 after several rounds of amendments, but it evidently wasn't enough.

SB 50 was ultimately defeated with a preponderance of greater LA area state senators voting against it. I understand some of them must represent sprawling single family districts that were always going to vote no, but certainly not all? Might we be able to vote some of these people out in 2020 and give upzoning another go around in the next session? I know a couple of GOPers who voted no are being challenged by dems but their districts are unlikely to support upzoning whoever they elect. I hope I'm wrong?

In California, gas cars made after 1975 must pass smog test and same for diesels made after 1998 too. I bet that very few cars fall under that category. How many people still daily drive a 1980 Firebird? I don't think raising the age for smog tests to classic car status (1995) would make much of a difference. Smog equipment on older cars can be a pain to work with anyway.

88,"If Liberals are so Fucking Smart, how Come They Lose so Goddamn Always?","The title of this post is a quote from HBO’s series “The News room” that I watched yesterday for the first time.  And honestly it really struck me.  I’m not going to sit here and pretend that the Republican Party isn’t pervaded by anti-intellectualism and stupidly because it is.  But seeing how that IS the case, then why are Liberals so constantly losing?

In general, having more education tends to correlate with leaning more to the Left.  And Democrats often tout themselves as being the party of science and intellect.  If that is the case, then why are we currently in the situation we are in?  Like, it shouldn’t even be a competition right?  The Left should be blowing out the Right in every election by a 20% lead.  For god’s sake you lost a presidential election against a literal cartoon character with no prior political experience.  If you’re so smart, why can’t you make yourselves attractive enough to win?  It should be child’s play for a party of big brains like you. 

Whenever I talk to people right-of-center, I get a pretty good variety of views from libertarian, far-right. neo-cons, it’s all over the place.   However, when I talk to more liberal people, I find much less variance.  Every view seems to boil down to “vote for me because the other guy is bad”.  There’s so little self-reflection and objective examination on ways their own ideology could morph or become better in a way that leads to real results.  It’s always the same old dying on a hill of moral superiority while the walls fall down around us, and I’m tired of it.

I feel like a lot of the Left is so caught up in an imaginary war of “good vs evil” in their own mind that they’re incapable of taking a step back and see the whole picture.  Life isn’t fucking Harry Potter, there is no absolute evil and absolute good that you can attach yourself to and support blindly.  All of the goals your party generally supports sound awesome: free healthcare, reducing wealth inequality, legalization of weed.  You should be winning by a landslide every time.

8,Why do our political beliefs seem to aline with the way we think of the mainstream &amp; view conspiracies?,"I asked here a few days ago what do you think of UFO activity &amp; as I assumed, almost all of you seem absolutely certain nothing from outer space has ever visited earth. If I’m allowed to assume again, almost all of you would require me to link what I’m going to call a “mainstream credible” scientific or news article as proof to even consider it if I told you we have been visited by other worlds (hypothetically). If a navy pilot says he’s absolutely seen a spacecraft that disabled his radar systems, that’s not good enough. 

It seems to me our capability to believe the unknown, to consider the unknown, to absolutely knowing for sure the unknown isn’t real - is more about who we already are as a person, before it is about our politics. Which leads me to think the way we already think naturally leads us to our political beliefs. For example, I do believe in some “conspiracies” &amp; I don’t believe everything I’m told from the mainstream is the truth, &amp; yet I’m a Trump voter. I believe you would have to think like me to be a Trump voter. I wouldn’t consider myself stuck way down the rabbit hole (though you might think so) but in my view I feel I cannot fully trust the mainstream narratives of society, whereas the moderate liberal does. For example of my insight, you can go to Vietnam today &amp; talk to the citizens about the torture American POW’s experienced in their prisons &amp; almost all of them absolutely will not believe you. They absolutely know for sure POW’s received even better treatment than their own citizens &amp; they have many sources to prove that. You’d be a conspiracy quack to think otherwise. But our mainstream narrative is POW’s were in fact tortured &amp; starved. Both cannot be true. One mainstream narrative has to be a lie. So for me, I don’t believe my own society is above fabricating our own truths. 

The moderate right seems to be much more accepting of ideas that cannot be linked from a “mainstream source” rather than the moderate left. As you get further politically right &amp; left, it would seem those types are capable of falling completely down the rabbit hole, which many makeup the anti-government radical types. For an easy example, one look at Twitter &amp; anyone can see many of the Bernie type voters believe DNC conspiracy has robbed Bernie the nomination twice, as many Trump supporters believe this too. I’m totally aware in this sub that’s considered absolute nonsense, &amp; I would consider this sub a great representation of the average liberal. 

Now a Trump supporter or Jimmy Dore type would say liberals do believe in conspiracies because they believed in the Russia collusion hoax (just as an example, not trying to debate the actual situation), but I would say no because every mainstream narrative said Trump colluded with Russia so in its context I wouldn’t consider it a conspiracy, but majority accepted truth of society - equally to the Vietnamese citizen who “knows” American POW’s were not tortured. 

I guess my fascination is how is it that you know for sure your societies mainstream view is correct? How do you know you’re not living in a bubble of your own information, such as those from other nations who’s mainstream we all would find completely delusional?

42,Do you think we should end the wat on drugs?,"Hello,

The strongest political opinion I hold today is based on the idea that we should end the war on drugs, legalize, regulate, and tax everything, marijuana, cocaine, heroine, etc. My rationale is written in the following paragraph, if you don't want to read it skip ahead to the last paragraph:

Basically the war on drugs has created a situation whereby there is a high demand for drugs (marijuana, cocaine, etc) but not a lot of suppliers (cause you know, it's illegal). As such, there are high profit margins and the only people willing to go after them are by definition willing to work outside the law.  This leads to the rise of drug smuggling. Now of course, there are natural limits on what routes you can take, what growing grounds you have access to, etc. This generates conflict. Cartels don't have access to the court system so how do they resolve conflict? Violence. This is what has driven narco violence in latin america, what lead pablo escobar to blow up a plane, what lead to shoot outs in the streets of mexico and it's shockingly high body count. Not only that, but other illegal groups can turn to drugs for cash as well. For a whole 75% of the worlds heroine was supplied by the Taliban and other affiliated groups. Drug money goes to fuel violent and illegal groups who use the money to buy weapons and bribe officials to resolve conflicts between one another and seize better routes and land. Inevitably, civilians get caught in the cross fire (the drug war has killed more people in mexico (a country at peace) alone than solider have died in afghanistan, an actual warzone). This money only further causes problems in much of the developing world as it goes to bribe officials, rig institutions for the benefit of traffickers and if course screw over the population who need government aid and security. This problem of drug money corruption is more prominent in the developing world but it's not like it doesn't exist in the developed either. Speaking of the developed world let's take a look at the country I am most familiar with: the US. The drug wat has fueled our incarceration rates, further driven racial disparities in policing, fueled police militarization (police felt they needed military equipment to fight cartels that had access to black market fire arms), etc. It has absolutely wrecked communities here in the us. That's not to even mention the effects of cutting drugs with stuff to save costs. In short, the drug war had caused massive massive problems through its nature. Why is legalization the answer? 1) profit margins are still high, so new business people are attracted to the industry. This creates competition. Since your local dispensary is easier to find and safer (cause regulation) than some clandestine dealer, new users are likely to use it instead. This takes money away from cartels and towards legit business. 2) Regulation can ensure the drugs aren't cut with anything. This makes them safer. 3) it can be taxed. Use this money to fund public rehab centers, needle exchanges, etc. You may be thinking, wouldn't making drugs easier to access be bad? Well, take a look at another dangerous addictive substance: nicotine. Smoking is at an all time low in the us thanks to regulation, public awareness, and taxation. Why the hell couldn't we do the same for cocaine? Sure it's more addictive, but that's where public rehab comes in, public medical help, etc. Plus it wouldn't be nearly as debilitating to people if it wasn't illegal, just saying. 4) we already did this. Alcohol used to be illegal and led to the rise of gangsters like al capone who used violence to get his way. Now, alcohol is legal, and we don't see alcohol gangs. There isn't a ton of violence associated with the trade like in the days of prohibition. That's obviously good. Sure, ending the war on drugs in its entirety may not kill the cartels, they traffick other illegal goods (weapons and the like) but it could really hit them in the wallet which would decrease violence cause they just can't afford it.


Anyways, for all the above reasons and more, I support a complete end to the war on drugs. What do you think? Agree disagree? Why/why not?",AskALiberal,1602886757

53,Should the following firearm related items be legal or illegal in the US?,"37mm Grenade launcher: It is legally seen as a flare gun and as long as the projectiles contain less than .25 ounces of explosives they are legal to use

Cannons: Think Revolutionary War cannons but maybe not as big

Short barreled rifle: ""shoulder-fired, rifled firearm, made from a rifle, with a barrel length of less than 16 in (41 cm) or overall length of less than 26 in (66 cm), or a handgun fitted with a buttstock and a barrel of less than 16 inches length."" That can include a hacked up hunting rifle or an AR-15 with a 10 inch barrel. Requires NFA tax stamp to own which takes a long time and a bit of money to get.

Short barreled shotgun: Pretty self explanatory, same legal buying process as a short barreled rifle

Machine guns: any firearm that can fire continously if the trigger is held down, different from semi automatic weapons. Currently, machine guns made before 1986 are legal but prohibitively expensive and NFA tax stamps cost money and take months or years to process. Licensed gun dealers can own and produce machine guns.

Surpressors: A muzzle end device that reduces report from a gun but does not always silence it. Also time consuming and expensive to buy. A suppressed AR-15 shooting standard ammunition has a decibel rating of 132 dB. That's 12 dB louder than a chainsaw

""High capacity"" magazines: AR-15's are designed to use 30 round magazines, but some people define them as high capacity.

Quick release magazines

Pistol

Semi automatic guns: One bullet per trigger pull, extremely common method of fire for modern weapons that range from squirrel guns, hunting shotguns, handguns and AR-15's. Technically, some old school revolvers are semi automatic.

Armor piercing pistols: Pistols that fire a specially designed round with an unusually high muzzle velocity capable of defeating soft body armor.

Classic firearms with ""rapid fire"" actions: Pump action shotguns with ""slam fire"" (M1898) and tuned lever action rifles that can have a rate of fire similar to a semi automatic AR-15.

55,Why Does it Seem Like Most Left-Leaning ideology is a Result of Living in an Urban Area?,"It seems like so many of the issues and concerns expressed by Liberal people are simply a by-product of them living in a major urban center that negatively impacts their quality of life.  Major cities with large populations consist of the following:

&gt;High cost of living 

&gt;Insane wealth inequality (pretty common to see multi-millionaires walk past starving homeless people on the street)

&gt;Low societal trust, theft is more common 

&gt;Soulless urban landscape and lifestyle is basically designed to induce some form of mental illness

&gt;Exorbitant home prices 

&gt;Traffic 

&gt;Little to no access to nature 

Obviously this list isn’t comprehensive, but it’s just a sample of what living in a large city like Sam Francisco entails.  Consequently, many of the issues faced by urban people also are big talking points on The Left:  addressing wealth inequality, improving social safety nets and services, promoting a culture of diversity, etc.  when you look at it objectively, it’s easy to see why this trend exists.  However, I can’t help but wonder if people are by design not meant to live in such large urban hubs.

Google brought up [this link](https://americanindependent.com/donald-trump-coronavirus-response-incredible-take-new-york-out-fox-news/):

&gt;DONALD TRUMP: There are places that have done badly. You know, New York has been the worst in the whole country. 40,000 deaths. New York has done very badly. He's done a bad job. Really bad job. Cuomo. And he writes books like he's supposed to be doing a good job.   
&gt;  
&gt;We had more deaths — if you take New York and a couple of places, I mean, you look at our numbers, they're incredible. But you take New York out, we have numbers that nobody can even compete with it. New York, a couple of places.   
&gt;  
&gt;But, no, New York what he's done with the nursing homes it's so sad to see, at least 11,000 people. Dead. That shouldn't be.

He said this and I checked it out. Even the [CDC admits](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#cases_totaldeaths) that there were 33,000 deaths in New York and that's by far the most of any state. I remember reading that most of those deaths were because Governor Cuomo killed many nursing home residents by sending COVID-19 positive patients.

And that number of deaths would have been even higher except that Trump sent one of [his hospital ships](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/21/coronavirus-trump-says-hospital-ship-usns-comfort-will-leave-new-york-city.html) to help out.

https://ballotpedia.org/California_Proposition_15,_Tax_on_Commercial_and_Industrial_Properties_for_Education_and_Local_Government_Funding_Initiative_(2020)

Full disclosure, I hate this proposition and think it will (further) destroy California. I will attempt to be reasonably fair though in how I pose these questions.

I consider a good summary of the changes to be - this proposition will cause property taxes on commercial and industrial properties worth $3 million and above to be based on ""market value"" of the property instead of original purchase price.

My questions are as follows - how is market value determined if there is no sale of the property? How do you tell a business how much their property is worth if they aren't selling it? 

Here's a different way to say it, I'm sure many of you are homeowners, is your property reassessed whenever an appraiser comes around and tells you how much they think your house is worth? For me, my income doesn't go up just because my house increases in value so that would be disastrous. Yes, it would of course be very nice if my home goes up in value but if my tax burden went up unreasonably as a result I would have to act against my own interests and beg the bank for an equity loan, putting me behind in paying down my mortgage.

I'm sure most of you have cars, and there is a car registration tax that must be paid every year. So what if someone decides your car is worth twice of what you paid for it? Are you prepared to pay much more in registration tax? See it's not like income tax because there's no actual income. It's effectively a ""wealth tax"" even though that wealth is not readily liquid. I'd really prefer to not have to sell my home or car just to pay a heavily increased tax bill.

It is the same thing with these businesses. Someone apparently is going to come around and say someone's property is worth x amount, which may be very different than what they consider it to be worth. It's like if you personally were appraised and despite making, for example, $15 an hour, it was determined that the ""market value"" of your labor was actually $25 an hour, and you would be taxed accordingly. That doesn't seem very fair to me, to have your taxes go up without a corresponding raise in income.

I worry that these appraisers are going to be entirely unregulated and unchecked, and cause businesses which are already struggling due to the virus to not be able to pay these increased property taxes and as a result lay people off. I consider the profit margin of many businesses to be grossly exaggerated, just because a property is said to be worth so much doesn't mean that the business can readily afford to pay taxes on that amount. If you are accustomed to paying registration on a car you purchased for $10,000, some random nobody saying your car is actually worth $20,000 doesn't magically make you able to pay the increased registration on that amount.

I think this proposition will actively discourage long-term investment in property which is key to stability in local communities. I feel this also imposes gentrification, as outside influence on the market value of established properties can price them out of the ability to continue to do business.

97,"Guys, we need to talk about how conservatives get their $100 Trillion price tag for the Green New Deal. It's truly incredible, so buckle up.","It appears that the figure originates from this [report](https://www.americanactionforum.org/research/the-green-new-deal-scope-scale-and-implications/) generated by the conservative think tank The American Action Forum. I highly recommend you read that, and also contrast it with what the Green New Deal actually says (read it [here](https://www.congress.gov/116/bills/hres109/BILLS-116hres109ih.pdf), it's only 14 pages). 

**First off**, people keep asserting the price is for each year, when it's actually the cost of the plan over 10 years. Plus, $100 Trillion is rounded up from the report's actual figure, $93 Trillion. So, you know, just a casual rounding error that is enough to fund the entire department of education for the next 100 years.

**Second**, you only get $93 Trillion if you add up all the upper-most ranges of every price they give. That's standard stuff I guess, but keep in mind their ""low range"" for the GND is almost half of the high range at around $50 Trillion. Not terribly precise if your range is literally twice the size of the U.S. GDP.

**Third**, the GND advocates for every American to have access to ""high quality health care"". That's it. It's literally just a single line in the bill. Of course, the report interpreted this as instituting Medicare For All, which they then just added to the cost of the GND! They pegged the cost at $36 Trillion/10 years, which is definitely on the high side of estimates, but it's at least not *totally* out of bounds I guess (most estimates I've seen put it at \~$30 Trillion). Still, it's not standard practice to just fucking add the cost of other bills into the ones you're looking at.

**Fourth, - get a load of this shit - they said that everyone making less than $15/hr will now make that much, and that the fucking government will be the one footing the bill for that wage increase. As if companies can now just bill the government for the increase in minimum wage. They said this would raise our taxes by over $44 Trillion. What the fuck.** 

For those of you keeping score at home, between just tacking on the cost of Medicare For All and pinning the minimum wage increase on the tax payers, we have already dropped this ludicrous figure from $93 Trillion, down to just $12.4 Trillion over ten years, and that's with *their* math for the rest of the GND.

$1.2 Trillion per year may sound like a lot, and it definitely is to an extent, but keep in mind we spend nearly $1 Trillion just on our military budget every year. 

I bring all this to your attention simply to say that anytime you hear a conservative say some shit about how the GND will cost a hundred gazillion billion, just know where they're getting their numbers from.

I always stop and don’t follow through, but I find it has become increasingly more difficult.  Maybe I’m just getting more jaded.  Sometimes I see the sarcastic and antagonistic responses from conservatives that I used to have good discussions with, and I realize they’ve given up making a good faith effort and it kind of makes me sad or think that I should just join them and start acting all jaded and accusatory when it comes to political discussion— certainly it would require less effort on my part, I suppose.

1,The biggest issue hurting American today is conservative ideology has split 95% of the population to vote against each other because of non-issues?,"
The middle class is what makes American Great. Prior to FDR actions, the USA was very much a two class state. If you were born into low income the odds that would improve for the next generation was less likely. Until the balance of power shifted into the hands of the majority of Americans. All citizens from cost to cost during FDR presidency thanks various social reforms, trust busting, support for unions, banking reforms, regulations and more all lifted 95% of citizens. Americans after WW2 has more individual opportunities to gain wealth though home  ownership and labor unions that represented the working man. More investments in public education helped all who worked hard achieve a sustainable life in the middle class or more. Farmers insurance and farm care subsidies help agriculture continue to improve without fear of losing  money. Social Security allowed older people to retire, unions increase income with good pension programs. All these reforms happened within a decade, and transform our nation. The real American Dream was a reality.  The poor has resources to lift themselves up, the majority who lived good hard working lives could achieve a middle class life that was well protected to ensure a teacher, nurse or tradesmen could have a good life without fear of losing everything should misfortune happen. Liberal ideology proved to be remarkably effective that other the next 20 years until Late 1960, more growth continued to keep the American Dream a reality. 

Until Nixon and the conservative ideology telling Americans big government is bad. Regulations are holding you back, liberal elites are running the nation was redirect that people stated to believe remains a damaging lie. When Regan enters office the majority of citizens who FDR lifted out of poverty began to believe they are all self made success stories. The 1980s was deregulation central, union busting, and many actions that dismantled the power of the majority, allowing more conservative special interest groups to take control. Religious groups start to become more political, fake issues like 2 amendment rights, undocumented immigration , gay marriage, abortion rights and more clouded many into thinking the conservative ideology was the side for the working many , the Main Street community, and the financial experts! 

However, the massive exodus of manufacturing institutions during the 1970/1980s removed the plants, laying off many, all kept their corporate offices and profits in the hands of very free Wall Street stakeholders. Meanwhile, pro big business tax policies never penalize or forced these Americans firms to pay state taxes to fund education resources to ensure citizens are ok. 

Still, part of the 95% believe it was liberal ideology fault their way of life was drowning. For most Americans in the middle class, especially boomers, had the feeling of added wealth was because by the 1990s the signal income family was dead. The majority of lower to middle incomes Americans all had two working adults in the family. That was not the case before the 1980s. 

The liberal ideology of the 1990s tax policies, reinstated regulations and the federal government created world wild web entered boomed into the private sector creating real sustainable jobs.  Only to be completely ripped apart. 
By this time the last great manufacturing opportunities in the USA are all part of the industrial military complex, almost all private firms; some building important resources, but many controlled by conservative elites to funnel taxpayers money away form investment that have a return on expenses. 

Furthermore, more and more blue states are leading the nation forward generating the overwhelmingly majority of federal tax revenue; once federal program are funded the majority of funds go to the poorest states who remain under conservative ideology leadership. Meanwhile, the federal government is funding a defense department that outsource 65% of their budget, fails to negotiate drug prices of medical services for Medicare Medicaid forcing taxpayers to pay huge markups, paying massive interests in the nation Debt - the majority of which was created by conservative ideology tax policy - leveling crumbs to fund education institutions, medical Research, scientific advancements, maintaining our infrastructure and many other important resources did you have a return on investment. 

As the middle class continues to eat the costs after each conservative ideology leadership crush’s  the economy, ultimately hurting and keeping the majority down and losing more each time. The crapshoot 401k retirement never a secure factor. Conservative regularly attack social security and the only remains critical retirement funds left. It takes its tool on people; healthcare costs continue to increase, food, education, housing , and more all continue to cost more , but every time a conservative crashed the economy, firms cut pay , jobs and still pull profits; causing the working class skilled or not, finding themselves setback. 

It has to stop; 95 % need to move past the conservative ideology that remains under the same ideology - bring back 1900s American. If you think religions values, guns or any of the lies they tell is true - ask yourself what have the done to make your life better ?",AskALiberal,1602740308

6,Supporter-Leader Symbiosis on the Left?,"Recently I read Bob Altemeyer's *The Authoritarians*, where he lays out two basic kinds of right wing authoritarians (RWAs). The first kind is the run-o'-the-mill follower type. These RWAs are often self-righteous and bigoted (whether subtly or overtly), but they don't necessarily take it upon themselves to aggress against wider society. What they do do is eagerly look for signs from their chosen elites that it is time to aggress -- see the Proud Boys' reaction to ""Stand back and stand by.""

The second kind of RWA is the social dominator, who is solely interested in dominating others. This kind is bigoted not out of the follower-type's fucked up morals, but simply because they like exercising power over minorities who can't fight back. The dominator will say the right words in order to gather a rabid cult of follower RWAs, and then sooner or later give them the signal to aggress against the wider society as a means of gaining power. So the two RWA types work symbiotically together.

And all this got me wondering if there is any kind of supporter-leader symbiosis happening with those of us of the progressive / liberal persuasion. Whether an honest/positive symbiosis, or a deceptive/negative one.",AskALiberal,1602732544

A link to the paper: [Policing the Police: The Impact of ""Pattern-or-Practice"" Investigations on Crime](https://ideas.repec.org/p/nbr/nberwo/27324.html).  Excerpt from abstract:

&gt;This paper provides the first empirical examination of the impact of federal and state ""Pattern-or-Practice"" investigations on crime and policing. For investigations that were not preceded by ""viral"" incidents of deadly force, investigations, on average, led to a statistically significant reduction in homicides and total crime. In stark contrast, all investigations that were preceded by ""viral"" incidents of deadly force have led to a large and statistically significant increase in homicides and total crime...

The paper discussed in a media source in June: [Harvard study finds black people die as a result of police pulling back after brutality protests](https://justthenews.com/government/security/harvard-study-finds-black-people-die-result-police-pullbacks-following).  Excerpts:

&gt;An upcoming study by Harvard economists found that many more black Americans die as a result of police drawdowns following high-profile, police brutality protests.  Police become skittish following viral, racially-charged police misconduct investigations, leading to reluctance to protect black neighborhoods, according to the to-be-released academic paper by Harvard economist Roland Fryer and co-author Tanaya Devi, reported on by The Wall Street Journal's Jason Riley. The study found that homicides and felonies spike immediately after the reported events in question, crime that hits black communities the hardest.

&gt;""When police were investigated following incidents of deadly force that had gone viral, police activity declined and violent crime spiked. It happened in Ferguson, Mo., after Michael Brown was shot by an officer. It happened in Chicago after a cop gunned down Laquan McDonald. And it occurred in Baltimore after Freddie Gray died in police custody,"" Riley wrote.

&gt;“...when I look at cities in which the investigation was preceded by a viral event,” Fryer told Riley, “homicide goes up considerably. Total crime goes up considerably. ...

I broached the subject about how Trump is still holding maskless rallies that's causing people to get severely ill. My father had this cognitive dissonance that prevented him from realizing that Trump is bad for the country. 

It took alot of convincing, but dad soon came to the conclusion that he should stay home this election. He absolutely can not vote for a democrat. It just the way he is. 

My point is that my dad suffered from alot of disinformation from conservative media. There is a huge irrational force in this country that is trying to convince us that the only way to fix our problems, is to rehire the very guy that fucked everything up from the very beginning. 

George Wallace only got 13% of the vote when he ran for President. Trump got 46%. How can we fix this? Conservatives, please feel free to opine on this...",AskALiberal,1602628679

46,Why shouldn’t I vote Trump?,"Tldr: I’m a white male from an upper class suburb of nyc with a big family that leans red. I am set to graduate college into a pretty lucrative career. Low taxes and low regulation are probably the most important policy positions for me in a candidate. I’m fiscally conservative and socially think government should be hands off. Thinking of voting third party because Trump is doing irreparable damage to the Republican Party and he has some terrible policy positions that will harm my generation in the future. 

——————

This may be the wrong sub to post this in but I figured I would give it a shot. I’m in Gen Z and this will be the first presidential election where I’m old enough to vote. I have been following politics since the election in 2016. At the time I really liked Kasich and Rubio and was surprised to see Trump snatch the nomination. I’ve never really been a fan of him, but I have some serious misgivings with the Democratic Party that preclude me from voting blue in the foreseeable future. 

For the past couple years I always assumed I would vote Trump in 2020 mostly because it would be a vote against whoever the Democratic candidate ever ended up being. I understood that Trump has made some pretty ignorant and downright rude and malicious comments, but I always thought that was irrelevant because I liked some of his policies. 

Over the past few weeks, I’ve looked at him a little more critically. It was hard to watch him struggle to denounce white supremacists during the debate. It’s hard to watch him call climate change a hoax when I know my generation will be dealing with the consequences. It’s hard to see him cut taxes but not cut spending, my generation will be dealing with those consequences as well/ And I know this is a changing country, his style of governing will pretty much guarantee Republicans lose power for years unless they are willing to adjust and improve messaging to minorities. 

Also, part of it is that I’m worried that in the future I will look back and know I was on the wrong side of history. I don’t want to be responsible for backing policy that seriously harms undeserving people. I feel like a lot of his anti-illegal immigration policy can be justified because it’s combatting an illegal practice. But are there policies that legitimately target undeserving individuals?

48,How much can we change while staying true to America?,"I grapple with this issue a lot. Conservatives, by virtue of being traditional, resistant to change, focused on the Constitution as-is, etc., have laid claim to protecting the true America. Progressives, by advocating for change, are therefore trying to move us away from what we’re all about (read: “liberals hate America and want to destroy it”.)

Personally, I’d argue that our country has never remotely lived up to its founding principles, and a lot of our 2020 progressive causes are just trying to bring America in line with its stated values. Also (as many point out), our Constitution is a living document that has a mechanism for fundamental changes, provided they have a wide base of support.

However, I wonder where we draw the line on how fundamentally we can change while still remaining true to the founding principles. For instance, could a full socialist America still be America, or is the (claim of a) free market so central to our identity that conservatives would be correct in claiming that it is unamerican to abandon it?

How about revoking the 2nd amendment entirely, without replacement? 

Or the 1st?

How do we fix this? Each state has so many different ways of governing; some are blue some are red, some have mail voting as an option some don’t, some actively try to sabotage their voting system (which is ILLEGAL) and others don’t. The only thing I could see working would be a constitutional amendment laying out voter rights that can’t be infringed upon, federal agents being sent to each voting station to make sure locals don’t try to ‘tamper’ with the system and sabotage it, and permanent district lines that can’t be changed to be gerrymandered.

74,"If you were the deciding vote on a policy championed by the wing of the party you are least politically aligned with, how would you proceed?","It's some indeterminate date in the future, and you are a Democratic party Senator. Some specific policy has been in committee for a while now, and after much deliberation, they have decided that the best solution is the one favored by the opposite wing of the party from you (if you're progressive, they went with the moderate solution. If you're moderate, they went with the progressive solution). The Republicans have continued the ""never vote for any Democratic legislation"" thing, so you know none of them will vote for it. The Democrats, meanwhile, know you're one of the ones who didn't explicitly support the plan they went with, but ended up having more support for the plan they decided on than any other plan and were able to get 50 other Senators to agree to it, so went ahead with the plan anyway. The house has signaled it would easily pass there, and the president has signaled that if the bill in its current state hits their desk, they would sign it.

Something happens right before it's time to vote on it though (after the point where it would be easy to make major changes to it has passed), and instead of being the potential 51st vote, you are now the crucial 50th. Your constituents have generally the same political views as yours, so they would be most happy with whatever action you would be inclined to do. So, despite not necessarily thinking it's the best plan, would you still vote for it?

Examples of policy differences may vary. The moderate solution may do its best to maintain an existing private market, while the left wing solution may be to nationalize some or all of it. It may be the difference between drug legalization and just decriminalization, or additional regulations to an existing industry vs a far more hardline stance against the problematic bits of it. Basically, if you're a progressive, imagine the legislation in question is seen as ""not going nearly far enough"", and if you're a moderate you see it as ""going way too far, way too fast"". Healthcare solutions are possibly the easiest to see those big differences on, but feel free to bring up any other issue where the progressive and moderate stances aren't particularly close together too. I welcome responses from both moderates and those farther left.

TL;DR- You are the deciding vote on legislation that is highly supported by the opposite wing of the party from you, despite you openly feeling that plan is not the best solution. Do you vote for it as is, or not?

10,How willing are you to forgive in politics ?,"Do you think the Democrats were wrong to not kick Robert Byrd out of the party ?

Robert Byrd, long time Democratic senator, was a member of the KKK early in his youth. He was still racist even when he was middle aged; he voted against the Civil Rights Act of 1964. He changed his views and fought against racism and for civil rights. Because of this he was forgiven by many Democrats including Joe Biden. He was honored by Democrats when he died.

It is no secret that the left views Trump as a bigot. However, Trump used to be a Democrat and regularly donated and endorsed Democratic candidates. Let's say Trump has a change of heart in the future and becomes an advocate for immigration reform, supports DACA, supports the ACA, supports BLM, dedicates the rest of his life to fighting islamophobia, starts paying his fair share of taxes, and apologizes for everything he has done in his administration would you respect him ?



Assume Trump loses this year. If he has a complete change of heart as mentioned in the paragraph above would you be willing to vote for him to do a non consecutive as President if he runs as a Democrat(assume his platform would be exactly the same as Biden's)



Do you think it would be logically consistent for Democrats to forgive Byrd for his KKK activities but not Trump for his pot stirring ?



David Duke used to be a Democrat in the 80s so I assume he has **some** sympathy for left wing views. 



If David Duke repented his decades of racism and decided to fight against systemic racism will you be willing to vote for him in any office if he ran as a Democrat and completely adopted the Democratic platform ?



Do you think former white supremacist who renounce their hateful ideology and work to try to undo the harm they have caused deserve a second shot(should receive support if they ran as Democrats) ?

54,"I'm a pro-gun libertarian socialist, I have two questions about guns.","**Content Warning: Discussion of violent crime, notably sexual violence**

So I've been reading [this](https://www.activeresponsetraining.net/resistance-to-violent-crime-what-does-the-research-show) article, which cites the following statistics:

* Research from the U.S. Department of Justice indicates that only 26% of all violent crimes (homicide, rape, sexual assault, robbery, and assault) were committed by offenders armed with some type of weapon. 10% of violent crimes involved the use of a firearm. Only 8% of rapes are committed by armed attackers.
* It has been my experience that many crime victims choose not to resist a violent attacker out of fears that the attacker may be armed. While this is certainly a valid concern, the facts show that the  majority of violent criminals do not use weapons in the commission of  their crimes!
* One author states that 30% of robberies are committed with unloaded guns. An additional 10-15% of the firearms used in crimes are replica, toy, or BB guns.
* One study from 1990 on criminal use of toy guns in urban environments indicated that 15% of  armed robbers used toy guns or air guns in the commission of their crimes.
* Many other firearms used in crimes are broken or non-functional.  In a study of weapons seized from criminals by my police department, 13% of the seized firearms were non-functional. We commonly encounter weapons with broken firing mechanisms, weapons loaded with the wrong  magazines or ammunition of the wrong caliber, and weapons clogged with grease or debris. To mirror the earlier referenced study, an additional 28% of the weapons seized from criminals by my department during the last few years have been unloaded. Combine the broken guns with the  unloaded ones and you will see that 41% of the actual guns seized from criminals wouldn’t work!
* Overall, fewer than 1% of violent crimes result in a gunshot injury. Most often, criminals use a firearm as a blunt object, striking the victim with it instead of shooting. Even if you evaluate only violent crimes committed by attackers armed with a firearm, only 4.6% of victims were actually shot.
* Criminals armed with knives and clubs were far more likely to use the weapons to inflict injury to their victims. Club assaults resulted in injury 36% of the time (most injuries were minor, however).  Knife armed attackers cut or stabbed their victims in 12.7% of violent crimes.
* Depending on the study, police hit rates range from 10-23%. Most authorities believe that criminals shooting at their victims do even worse. 
* Some criminals do not even try  to injure someone when they fire their guns. In an interview with 184 felons imprisoned for using a firearm during the course of a crime, 40% of the felons said they fired their guns to “scare the victim” or “to get away”. Only 34% stated that they shot to “injure” or “kill” the victim.
* A 1970s NYPD study showed that criminals shooting at police officers only hit with 11% of the rounds they fired.
* The U.S Department of Justice estimate that victims received gunshot  wounds in only about 3% of nonfatal violent crimes involving the use of a  firearm.
* Another study of nearly 200,000 state inmates reports  that only 30% of all inmates who discharged firearms in the course of their crimes injured or killed their intended victims. Not all of those  injuries or deaths were related to gunshot wounds, however.  
* On the basis of these two studies, we can safely assume that if a criminal fires a gun at you during the course of a crime (even if he fires multiple times) he will only hit you between 3% and 30% of the time.
* 92% of victims hospitalized for a firearms injury are discharged from the hospital alive. 
* 47% of victims of gunshot wounds are treated and released without an overnight stay!
* Almost half of the victims shot during a criminal assault were wounded in the extremities (hand, arm, foot, or leg) only.
* Firearms assaults have a lethality rate of 5.4%. Knife assaults kill victims in 1.1% of cases. These statistics can be compared with a .06% lethality rate for assaults using bodily weapons (hands, feet, etc).
* 71.4% of victims of violent crime took some type of self-protective measure. Such measures include  screaming, running, physically fighting the attacker, and using a weapon, among other things.
* The probability of serious injury in a criminal attack is 2.5x greater for women  offering no resistance than women resisting with a firearm. Men are also safer if they resist with a firearm than if they do not resist at  all, but the difference is smaller (1.5x less likely to be injured).
* Unarmed resistance, on the other hand, does positively correlate with  an increased rate of injury in most crimes. One study showed that, during a retail robbery, unarmed resisting store clerks were 50x more likely to be killed than clerks who did not resist. 
* Victims resisting robberies are 20% more likely to be injured than victims who comply with the robbers’ demands.
* 86% of resisting victims are injured as compared to 66% of compliant victims. Presence of a weapon by the criminal does not influence injury rates.
* Injury rates are the same between victims attacked with weapons and victims attacked by unarmed criminals (26%), although victims attacked by armed criminals were about 3.5x more likely to suffer serious injuries.
* Researcher David Luckenbill found that if a victim resisted a robber, the robber was just as likely to abandon the scene without further action as to apply force.
* Studies dealing with the crimes of rape or sexual assault on women are extremely contradictory.  Almost all studies indicate that women who resist sexual assault are more likely to be injured (beyond act of rape itself) than women who do not resist. 
* When you include the rape act itself as an injury, however, the difference in injury rates between  compliant victims and resisting victims is only about 10%. This is partially due to the fact that resisting victims are less likely to be raped than passive victims. I will discuss this aspect in more  detail later in the paper.
* One meta-analysis, controlling for type of resistance, victim/offender relationships, location, and  demographic characteristics, reports that women were least likely to be  injured in assaults if they employed some *non-physical*  (arguing, screaming, threatening to call police, etc.) method of  resistance.  Non-physically resisting victims suffered fewer injuries  than women who either physically resisted or complied with their  attackers (19).  Additionally, specific to the crime of rape, *amount* of resistance is not correlated to *amount* of injury.  There is also no correlation between presence of a weapon and amount of injury in rape cases (20).
* It is important to note that, when examining statistics on  resistance, a positive correlation between resistance and injury does  not necessarily imply that the resistance *caused* the offender to injure the victim. Stated another way, victims may choose to resist *as a result of being injured.* 
* In fact, some research indicates that the majority (79%) of women injured in a sexual assault were harmed before the assault took place. 
* This study and others may imply that use of force by the criminal  may act as a stimulus for the victim’s resistance. Furthermore, the majority of injuries occurring during any crime are minor, (cuts, scrapes, bruises, and contusions). With regards to the crime of rape, only 7.7% of the victims suffered a serious injury other than the rape itself.
* A woman who physically resists a rapist doubles her chance of escaping rape.
* One study correlated the victim’s success in avoiding rape during an attack with the methods she used to resist. Victims crying or pleading were raped 96% of the time. Victims who loudly screamed were raped between 44% and 50% of the time. Victims who ran were raped 15% of the time. Victims who forcefully resisted (without a weapon) were raped 14% of the time. Women who resisted with knives or guns were raped less than 1% of the time
* Another study asked resisting victims of violent crimes whether their  resistance helped or hurt their situations. The responding victims overwhelmingly stated that resistance helped them in the majority (63%) of cases. This statistic holds true for all of the crimes examined (rape, robbery, and assault). Resistance only hurt their situations about 9% of the time.article accurate?

**Questions**

* Are the studies cited in the article accurate?
* Are there any studies that indicates an increase in guns are associated with an increase in homicide, sexual violence, robberies, assaults and other forms of violent crime (+ suicides)? Most studies I've seen indicate that more guns = more gun crime, which is a really misleading statistic.",AskALiberal,1602324713
55,"The majority of countries imposed travel restrictions on Chinese travelers, but very few liberal democracies did so -- with the U.S. being the most notable exception. Why did the liberal democracies go that route? Will history show that they made the wrong or right choice?","As the Coronavirus began to spread beyond China's borders, hundreds of countries imposed travel restrictions on Chinese travelers and people who had traveled through China.

Within the first few days of February, Japan, South Korea, Australia, New Zealand, Italy, and the U.S. did the same. But few others among the rest of the liberal democracies would do the same.

As the pandemic raged on, the White House would point to that early action as a bold step that saved American lives and proof that the administration was less inept than it's been given credit for.

56,How do I rebuttal this?,"Recently I was in a debate online where I put forth that the protests have been overwhelmingly peaceful. Then in reply I was told that police encounters are overwhelmingly peaceful and do not end in death... I tried to say you can't really compare the two. Then they came out with some statistics.

[1 in 500k people are struck by lightning in a year.](https://www.cdc.gov/disasters/lightning/victimdata.html) While, on the high end(if you assume some cops are planting guns/knives) about 100 unarmed blacks are killed by police each year. So that's about 1 in 400k blacks. Roughly the same number of unarmed blacks are killed by police as people in the US are struck by lightning.

Then you have to figure, and I'm just being honest here, Obama's DOJ found that 'hands up don't shoot' unarmed Michael Brown punched a cop and reached for his gun before they took him down. Just because they're unarmed doesn't mean every shoot was unjustified.

I really don't know how to rebuttal this argument. The odds of a black being killed by a cop are analogous to being struck by lightning... it makes me feel like there are better ways to use our time and energy. Like, for instance, why don't we demand a sin tax on sugars? I 100% gaurantee if we made simple carbs and sugars harder for low income individuals to get. There would be -a lot- more than 100 lives saved per year from diabetes and heart disease.

So I’m an undecided voter from Pennsylvania who has to turn in his absentee ballot by the end of the weekend. I’m truly leaning toward Biden, but often find myself extremely off-put by the way that Liberals engage with others/present their points of view on various online formats.

As an active twitter and Instagram user, my feed is exploding with people wishing Trump would die of Covid and trying to make cheap jokes to earn political points.

Furthermore, I often find that Liberal politicians that I really tend to agree with on policy, seem so focused on getting “epic burns” and “owns” on Trump, rather than actually selling me on their policy and plans for the country.  As an example, although I agree with a ton of what the members of ""The Squad,"" such as Ilhan Omar and AOC vouch for, the way that they partake in trying to ""dunk on people"" and ""own"" people online is really off-putting to me, and I'd say the same thing about it if conservatives were doing so. As another example, after the Debate, everyone was focused on the fly and Kamala’s “I’m still speaking”’ shtick, rather than how she repeatedly exposed Pence on certain issues or maybe had her own lacklustre moments. I just felt like the interruptions are a unfortunate part of any debate, and trying to sell me on Kamala as some sort of tragic hero being mansplained to by Pence felt extremely immature and unproductive. Kamala is a smart and powerful woman on her own, I don't need people making excuses for her and trying to paint her as weak or unable to handle the debate.

So I don’t know. Maybe I’m just an idiot for caring about this stuff. But, I think it’s just an unfortunate facet of how my demographic consumes information and news.

The same goes for universal healthcare. I support Medicare for all, but I would settle for a public option that was truly a public option that anyone could opt in for, that is not a means tested expansion of Medicaid. Without mentioning trump, how would you convince me to vote for Biden, who appears to be backing away from a public option in favor of a Medicaid expansion, and who said he would veto Medicare for all?

I also support legalization of marijuana federally, across the board. Biden doesn’t. So without mentioning trump, why should I vote for Biden?

I have more, but most of the arguments in favor of voting for Biden center around “he’s not trump”. I get that, but I still have problems with Biden and I don’t think I could vote for him.

&gt; **Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said Thursday that Democrats will hold an event on Friday to discuss the 25th Amendment amid concerns over President Trump’s coronavirus diagnosis.**
&gt; 
&gt; “Tomorrow, by the way, tomorrow, come here tomorrow. We're going to be talking about the 25th Amendment. But not to take attention away from the subject we have now,” she said in response to a question at a press conference regarding a possible coronavirus stimulus package.
&gt; 
&gt; **When pressed for clarification as to whether Pelosi believes it is time to invoke the 25th Amendment, she declined to provide an explicit answer but hinted the discussion was tied to what she said was a lack of transparency from the White House over Trump’s health.** The amendment delineates presidential succession and authorizes the vice president and a majority of Cabinet members to declare a president ""unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office.""
&gt; 
&gt; **Pelosi announced later Thursday that she will unveil legislation on Friday with Rep. Jamie Raskin** (D-Md.), a constitutional law expert, that would **create a commission to determine whether a president is fit for office.**
&gt; 
&gt; Raskin originally introduced legislation in 2017 — which did not get any legislative action since Republicans controlled the House at the time — that **would create an Oversight Commission on Presidential Capacity comprised of physicians, psychiatrists and retired public officials** like former presidents and Cabinet secretaries. Congressional leaders would be responsible for naming members of the commission.

Is this just a gambit to get the White House to be more transparent about Trump's health? If so, it seems like a big one. Does Pelosi know something we don't, namely that Trump's health is significantly worse than is publicly known to be?

20,How many people honestly feel that Harris won last night’s debate?,"I’m genuinely curious what you saw that I didn’t.

Full disclosure: I thought that last week’s debate was a disaster and neither candidate did that great, though I thought Biden came across incredibly weak as a leader.

That being said, I thought Pence completely destroyed Harris, demonstrating a stronger performance than that of 2016 with Kaine despite having arguably more to defend.

Now, both candidates dodged questions, and I don’t blame them for many, especially the one insinuating their running mates were too old to make it to a full term.

Kamala did fine, but she sure didn’t “wipe the floor” with Pence as I’m sure many of you were hoping.  This morning’s headlines were already written the moment she was announced as Biden’s VP pick though.

The mansplaining argument is absolutely ridiculous too.  Pence could’ve sat at the desk and said nothing for 90 minutes, and the media would’ve cried out that “his silence was drowning out Kamala’a voice, interrupting and mansplaining at every turn.”

Every fact check report you see lists 20 things that Pence supposedly said wrong and not a thing about what Harris said, despite their being plenty of misleading elements on both sides.  

There was a small, but significant misleading   fact about Lincoln thrown in there by Harris, and we’re not hearing anything about that.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;JP Morgan Chase says it will dedicate $30 billion to closing the racial wealth gap, from granting loans that help Black and Latino Americans purchase homes to helping the unbanked open checking and savings accounts.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;“Systemic racism is a tragic part of America’s history,” Jamie Dimon, JP Morgan Chase's chairman and CEO said in a statement. “We can do more and do better to break down systems that have propagated racism and widespread economic inequality, especially for Black and Latinx people. It’s long past time that society addresses racial inequities in a more tangible, meaningful way.”  
&gt;  
&gt;In addition to financing 40,000 mortgages totaling $8 billion, JP Morgan Chase will direct another $4 billion toward helping 20,000 Black and Latino homeowners shave their borrowing costs by refinancing. It's also committing to helping renters, spending $14 billion to help pay for the building and rehabilitation of 100,000 affordable rental units.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Businesses in largely Black and Latino neighborhoods will get technical assistance, coaching and a financial boost from $2 billion in loans.  And JP Morgan plans to spend $750 million with Black and Latino vendors.   
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;New branches opened in underserved neighborhoods will enable 1 million people to open bank accounts at minimal cost. And JP Morgan Chase says it will invest in financial institutions helmed by Black and Latino Americans, contribute $2 billion to initiatives focused on those communities, and track its own internal goals to have a more inclusive workforce by making those markers a factor in performance evaluations.

Durham's investigation may lead to more revelations, and has already led to one indictment. 

Now we have more classified information being released, some of which could be very damning for both the previous administration and the entire narrative around Trump/Russia that dominated the first two years of his term.

73,Why is certain knowledge so taboo?,"I spent my 20's in a very liberal large city, coming from a small (1400) town. The question of rent control came up in local politics because certain companies were doubling peoples rent overnight during the winter. The presiding government is very liberal. I identified with the left my whole life as I saw most right wing policies as a cynical power grab for the rich and powerful until this experience made me question what I was actually supporting and I slowly drifted away, or, imo, the party drifted away from me.

I am opposed to businesses doing this to people and am in favor of rent controls. However, the rent control in question was capped at inflation, when historically this has shown to be not in the best interest of the working poor, especially in cities. A better cap is 3-5 points above inflation. You get all the benefits without any of the drawbacks.

When I pointed out this, seemingly obvious, fact to my peers who are very personally invested in politics and use it shape their identity, I was crucified. I kid you not, I was somehow evil and a conservative and all the labels that come with it for understanding that landlords need to make a profit to keep things stable and well maintained. It effected my personal life as I was now treated as someone who is suspicious and a secret conservative or something.

It's kinda making me doubtful of my beliefs and if someone put forth to me the argument it makes, I don't really have a response.

But c'mon. He's up 8, 9, 10 points, and even in the swing states that matter he's up past the margin of error. It's arguable whether or not his debate helped him, but the numbers post-debate show it definitely hurt Trump.

Biden is doing well in states that shouldn't even be close. We're talking Texas, Georgia, Mississippi, South Carolina...don't get me wrong, he'll lose all those. But the fact that they're even *competitive* is absurd.

By this same time in 2016, Hilary wasn't even close to Biden's numbers, the race was tightening, and she never had even the highest points that Biden still carries.

And the issue of covid right now is the number 1 issue for Americans, and a wide majority believes Trump mishandled this crisis, not to mention could have prevented his own infection.

But I'll tell you what, I'll take it one step further, I think dems are going to squeak in a majority in the senate as well.

We'll lose Doug Jones, because he's in Alabama and he's no longer running against a pedophile. But we'll beat Tom Tillis, Susan Collins, Cory Gardner, and Martha McSalley will become the first senator in history to lose back to back senate races.

At first I thought it was some slang chicanos were trying to push due to their ignorance about Spanish/Portuguese grammatical structure, but apparently more than 98% of American Latinos, who are hilariously more progressive than Latin Americans, hate that term too.

For what it looks it sounds like an attempt to say romance language speakers are primitive because our pronouns and nouns are all gendered; in reality latinx is impossible to pronounce in Spanish/Portuguese/Italian/French/Catalan/etc. All the times those Americans with big accounts say that word to celebrate something called 'Hispanic Heritage Month' Latin Americans call them down because it's just patronizing but they just won't stop it.

&gt;Democrats seemed to have grow more bullish about a deal going into last weekend. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Friday on MSNBC she was “optimistic” about a deal, saying Trump’s positive COVID-19 diagnosis “changes the dynamic.” She and Mnuchin talked Monday as they continued to work through remaining areas of disagreement.

&gt;Pelosi said in a letter to House Democrats Friday she and Mnuchin were working through five main areas of disagreement:

&gt; * The dollar amount of the federal boost to unemployment benefits
&gt; * Funding for school and state and local governments
&gt; * Tax credit provisions for children and families 
&gt; * Testing and contact tracing funding
&gt; * Appropriations for Democratic priorities like transit

When that failed Trump tried to talk down Biden. Calling him Sleepy Joe, insisting he had dementia, etc. None of his attacks seemed to stick as Biden’s leads have been wildly consistent.

3,As an Immigrant Homosexual I have a experienced a lot of Liberals telling me “I can’t be a Conservative” because of my sexuality and Origin. Why do/don’t you feel that way?,"I’m a gay ex-muslim Conservative, Refugee male from Iran. The amount of times liberals basically claiming I couldn’t be a right winger/conservative and say I should be forced to be left wing or else “I’m a traitor” is astonishing and actually very frightening.

I mainly have Conservative values like pro-life, pro-gun, pro- free market, small government, anti- illegal immigration, support law and order and I don’t support the lgbtq, antifa and BLM, as I feel those groups are led by radical and authoritarian ideals.

I haven’t felt represented by the left wing for nearly a decade now.

So how would I not be a Conservative?

 There are many Conservative homosexuals. Just like there are conservatives of all races and there are atheist and agnostic Conservatives.

Conservatism and the Right Wing are political ideologies, not religious, sexual or race based ones. Yet I feel many vocal Liberals feel it should be that way. Joe Biden’s “if you don’t vote for me you aren’t black” remark is a great example.

We are all individuals with our own opinions, politics and beliefs, We are free to have our own political ideology, spirituality and life.

I get called a “islamophobe” A LOT for criticising the anti-homosexual rhetoric from my OWN past religion and culture liberal people.

I even get called a racist against Muslims while I’m A Dark Skinned Persian and was a Muslim myself.

My criticism and frankly; hatred, towards Islam comes from experience and knowledge with/of the Religion. Not because of blind hatred.

Which brings me to another BIG issue with The Left in my opinion: they protect Islam like some poor puppy while fiercely and openly hating and attacking Christianity and Judaism. 

As an ex-muslim I think Islam is a very dangerous and oppressive doctrine. I had to flee my own country as I came out of the closet and the government, my own family and my muslim “brothers and sisters” wanted me dead.

It troubles me severely how many left winged people, those who used to protect homosexuals, are now protecting a gay hating religion and their followers that kill unbelievers and homosexuals, oppresses woman and even in some countries still have slaves TO THIS DAY. 

I try to have a deep discussions about the Islamic homophobia and my experience in Iran, with Muslims and the Asylums and the way they treat homosexuals. But many times I call put the verses or my experience towards Liberals they suddenly treat me like I’m the reincarnation of Hitler.

I get flat out told by people that they don’t believe I feel this way, that I’m lying or that I just had some bad experiences and Islam is a loving religion.

And as last there are MANY homosexuals, in my experience, that DON’T want Trans Activism to be part of “the gay agenda” and activism and I increasingly meet homosexuals that OPPOSE the LGBTQ+ instead of being part of it. (myself included)

Many homosexuals have their own opinions, thoughts and issues with Transsexuality but, again in my own experience; The Left says “agree with the LGBTQ a 100% and don’t ask questions or you are a Bigot!”

Causing more critical Homosexuals like myself to oppose the LGBTQ and the Left Wing even more.

I feel like Liberal people try to control my life and my opinions constantly and even go as far as to deny my existence, as I often get the reaction: “A gay, ex muslim Right winger? Yeah you are just a Troll dude!”

I feel this attitude simply makes them live in a fantasy world ruled by ironically sexist, homophobic and racist identity politics. 

All of this contributes to me/us not feeling represented by the Left anymore and I really think that if this “victim mentality” and “identity politics” will keep being the main agenda of the left they will drive a lot of, otherwise progressive and liberal people, to the right wing.

There was a similar story for education. He's more interested in providing grants than actually increasing the amount of infrastructure in education. Which historically has just driven up college prices. 

He also wanted to like imposing a quota based affirmative action system that makes sure that 23% of government contractors are owned by minority race businesses. Which basically translates to ""race matters more than quality"".

27,Has anyone found that their Republican parents or people they know just do not care about something until it happens to them?,"I FaceTimed with my parents yesterday and asked if trump getting covid made my dad more worried about getting it and he said not at all, Trump is 9 years older and less healthy than him and blah blah blah. He didn’t seem to get that if the president of the United States could get coronavirus, he could too, and that the secret service was supposed to protect him from things like that. 

He ended up saying that if it doesn’t affect him he doesn’t care about it, point blank. Like the fires in CA right now don’t affect him so he doesn’t waste his time worrying about them. It just boggles my mind honestly how he’s so comfortable with that world view. Not caring about something until it happens to you is reckless because it literally means you don’t have a drop of empathy in your body, and that you could have voted for measures to help prevent the thing that is happening to other people from happening to you but you don’t because you’re stupid.

Like look, I get having too much empathy for other peoples sufferings can sometimes be mentally exhausting, but there has to be something type of balance between ‘I care so much about everyone’s suffering I can’t sleep at night’ to ‘well it’s not happening to me so they can kick rocks’

* Do you think the sexual component of the performance enhances, or undercuts, the political component?

* Is ""Daniel Cameron is no different than the sellout negroes that sold our people into slavery"" an effective call to action or does it simply go too far?

45,"After our recent drama where Uber/Lyft were 24 hours away from being shut down in California, there's a voter referendum on the ballot to exempt ride-share and delivery apps from California labor laws. What's the right thing to vote for?","Background: Uber has been operating unlawfully in California as its employees do not qualify as independent contractors under state law, and are entitled to mandatory employee benefits such as healthcare, overtime, blah blah.

Uber has been trying to get away with this by claiming it's a software company with drivers that use its app, and its only employees are their tech workers. A judge said this was bullshit because it is.

In early August, the state ordered the apps to classify their drivers as employees within 10 days. The afternoon before midnight August 20th, the deadline when the apps would have shut themselves down, a judge delayed the order because even though they're right, they're still not crazy.

Uber and Lyft's new goal is a voter campaign to add ride-share and delivery app drivers to the list of professions that are automatically independent contractors and exempt from AB 5. Both companies contributed $30 million each at the start, now together with DoorDash it's up to $180 million. The companies also claim their drivers favor their independence 4-to-1 from submitted feedback. Pro-union groups lead the ""No"" initiative and have raised $5 million.

This seems to me to be a classic ideals v reality fight. The gig economy is both super useful and a perversion of established regulations. I live in California and want Uber to survive here, the drivers I know are all leaning yes to keep their schedules flexible, but on the other hand I hate how it's another example of ""make enough money and the rules don't apply to you"".

65,Can’t decide whether to vote for Trump or Biden and it all comes down to who has the best economic/tax plan. Can anyone please help or provide more information?,"Long story short, I’ve looked a lot into the platforms of Trump and Biden. There’s a lot that I like and a lot that I dislike about each. In the end they sort of balanced out and it came down to one issue, which is also the most important to me, the difference in tax plans. Unfortunately in my research I managed to find a lot of fluff on this subject but not much too specific from either candidate.

So here I’ll lay out what I’ve found for each candidate and hopefully y’all can add to this or correct my findings in order to help me reach a decision. 

Trump-

1. He passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in 2017 which lowered the three tax brackets I’ll fall into from (10,15,25%) to (10,12,22%) and obviously these brackets were lowered after moving from a Democrat to a republican president.

2. He’s floated the idea around for awhile about a 10% tax cut for the middle class that would effectively lower the 22% bracket to only 15% BUT he’s floated this around for about a year and nothing has been done also hasn’t really been mentioned in his campaigning or in the first debate.

3. Conservatives are generally in favor of lower taxes in an ideological sense.

Biden-

1. Has promised many times not to raise taxes on anyone making less than 400k a year.

2. Hasn’t mentioned cutting middle class taxes, just keeping them the same. And providing several tax credits (although none of these would currently apply to me but may in the future)

3. Reestablish the first time homebuyer tax credit (up to 15k) and I’ll be looking to buy my first home most likely around 2026-2028

4. Minimum wage increase to $15 nationally

5. Democrats unfortunately tend to favor higher taxes.


Important to note - I’m currently 21, 2 years away from graduating college and becoming a teacher in the state of Texas. That is a union job making around 55k a year with an average $500 a year raise and mandatory pension contribution plus I plan to put an extra 12% into a Roth IRA, mutual funds, and ETF’s.

In fact, in [one of her ads](https://twitter.com/davidschankula/status/1311720545612754944?s=19) she attacks McConnell from the right and tries to appeal to Trump supporters by accusing him of obstructing Trump's agenda.

The view of most liberals and moderate Democrats nowadays is that left wing Americans should vote Democrat even if they aren't satisfied with Democrats' policies because defeating Trump and weakening the GOP is paramount. Do you feel this still applies to McGrath? And is it worth defeating McConnell if his replacement is going to be a Trump ally anyway?",AskALiberal,1601763418
68,Are we in an age where only the most popular media can be correct?,"So I don’t mean this question to come off in “conspiracy territory”, though I’d be curious about that as well, but rather I’m curious how liberals perceive information. In my view &amp; from what I’ve experienced interacting online, the only truth liberals are willing to know is what is backed by the most popular media outsells such as CNN, MSNBC, AP, NPR, etc. Whenever we need to cite sources here on reddit those sources are almost always articles from those shall I say “acceptable” media outlets, &amp; if I were to share a source from any outlet liberals are not familiar with already trusting it would be discredited. 

Lately I’ve been watching some of the senate hearings &amp; I see issues that I find very significant, however right now they are pro-republican issues &amp; I feel that automatically means it’s all false or taken out of context in any liberals opinion. I feel there’s no way it would even be given the chance to be viewed as having any truth here. However we also went through years of the same investigations being against Trump, &amp; I feel the view is most any information that came out of that is absolutely considered truth here, no question. So for example, if NPR said Mueller said it, then that is absolutely how it happened. 

I feel liberals tend to resist any type of independent thinking &amp; fully believe if it’s science &amp; John Hopkins agrees, then it’s absolutely scientific fact - &amp; any other possibilities that someone else brings up is off the table. On the flip, I feel conservatives are much more likely to think the mainstream is out to get them leaving them more susceptible to believing the less popular idea. You can look through the conservative sub &amp; it’s mostly news articles I have no idea who the company actually is. 

So in my opinion, I think liberals would be fairly easy to control through propaganda or paid science. I feel you are almost shunned by liberals to seek outside unpopular information. There have been CNN type headlines “Trump said drink bleach, Trump will not denounce white supremacy, Trump said virus is a hoax” &amp; I’m almost convinced liberals genuinely believe that is true, &amp; **not** just being politically dishonest. And I think conservatives are much more difficult to control, much more resistant to information, but also much more acceptable to fall for completely delusional ideas as well as the accidental rejection of real truth if the real truth is of the popular. Which is why I consider myself in the middle &amp; enjoy seeing both angles.

OFAC's stated legal interpretation is that if an individual or company pays the ransom, and the payment violates the sanctions policy because the payee is part of the imposition of said sanctions, then the payor is in violation of the sanction.

The Trading With the Enemy dates back to the early 20th century, and under current law violation could land some person or company pretty hefty financial penalties and you name will end up on \[this\]( [https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/financial-sanctions/civil-penalties-and-enforcement-information](https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/financial-sanctions/civil-penalties-and-enforcement-information)) list.

She has always been very rational, logical, and left-leaning, though I've known her to enjoy the odd conspiracy theory here and there—9/11 was an inside job, moon landing was faked, that sort of thing. 

However, in the last year, she has fallen fully and deeply into the QAnon delusion. It's basically all she can talk about, and it's gotten to the point where she is actively cutting out friends and family who gently push back or disagree with her. Today, she had a screaming match on the phone with my mom, which ended in my aunt hanging up on her. She is already quite isolated (no kids, no partner, bit of a hoarder), and I'm worried for her, and scared that she's going to shut out and chase away everyone who cares, and just get deeper and deeper into this madness. 

I live in Toronto, she lives about an hour away in a suburb. I don't own a car. I'd like to try to make more of an effort to see her in person, drop by, check in—but with the pandemic happening, her age and pre-existing conditions, and my lack of transportation, I don't think that's possible. 

I would really like to have *some* kind of conversation with her about it by phone or email, even if it goes nowhere, but I'm not sure where to start. This [Buzzfeed article](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/janelytvynenko/qanon-families-friends) about people losing loved ones to Q really resonated with me, but also scared me, as the prevailing answer to ""how do we help deprogram"" seems to be, ""you can't"". But I don't want to give up on her. 

Does anyone have any experience or luck with this? Any words of advice? Thoughts on an approach or talking points? She seems to be coming from a place where she believes all media lies, and that she is ""doing her independent research""—should I chip away at that aspect, maybe poke holes and ask why anonymous, unverified internet sources are somehow trustworthy?

I appealed the ban asking for an explanation of how anything within my post could be considered a promotion of hate, given that I was defending BLM. Within an hour, I received a reply claiming that they had ""reviewed the post within the context and the appeal would not be granted"".

In the days following my ban, I carried out an experiment. I began reporting posts from right-wing subs that very clearly violated the Reddit Content Policy. Posts that either explicitly promoted hatred or violence and posts that aggressively promoted hatred against the Black Lives Matter movement or supported right-wingers murdering protesters.

I chose 10 of the worst posts I could find, documented the permalinks and noted the usernames of the posters. Every post I reported was given the following response:

&gt; Hey there,

&gt; Thank you for reporting this to us and we're sorry to hear about this situation. We have reviewed this content for any sitewide violations and have resolved the issue. Thank you for reporting this to us and if you see something else that you believe may violate our Content Policy, please let us know.

The users who posted the comments I reported are still actively posting, which means no action was taken or Reddit admins determined that these posts did not violate their content policy. I'm not sure what they mean when they say they have ""resolved the issue"".

42,How have you dealt with Trump Supporting loved ones that have contracted COVID-19?,"So I know this may be a bit specific but I’m in a situation where my dad who is 68 years old, has diabetes, is overweight, and was a smoker for 40+ years. 

We unfortunately had a death in the family recently (not COVID related) so my partner and I flew back home to stay with my parents for the funeral. I tried setting clear expectations on how we’d proceed with the funeral and being in public etc. My parents political views have gotten further and further right. They only get news from Fox, Rush, OANN, etc. It’s really damaging to my relationship with them and I don’t know how to approach it. 

My mom was constantly complaining about wearing a mask and not properly wearing it in public. During the funeral, we had agreed to all wear masks because my aunt had just tested positive. But my dad refused to wear a mask during the funeral and was REGULARLY interacting with my aunt the entire time we were staying with them. 

 
I can’t imagine I’m the only one who’s been in this situation, so I’m curious if anyone has had a similar experience with their family and how did you navigate?

Only then will a truly complete democracy become possible and be realized, a democracy without any exceptions whatever. And only then will democracy begin to wither away, owing to the simple fact that, freed from capitalist slavery, from the untold horrors, savagery, absurdities, and infamies of capitalist exploitation, people will gradually become accustomed to observing the elementary rules of social intercourse that have been known for centuries and repeated for thousands of years in all copy-book maxims.

Both sides would share the blame as was the case before this latest round of negotiations. This would be okay because we had and have the advantage going into the elections with a dead stimulus bill. 

Sure it would be better for the country if it passed, but it is time to start putting party first like the GOP does and not unilaterally disarm in this respect or any respect.

There is only a narrow case where someone would be exempted, and it only lasts for 1 year anyways.

&amp;#x200B;

As my post from yesterday no doubt indicates, I am rather interested in the Swedish economic model. I recently watched a video produced by a Swedish libertarian (for the record, I am not a libertarian, I'm a liberal (yes those are two different things)), and he gave the bike helmet company Hovding as an example of difference in regulation between the US and Sweden. Hovding makes bike helmets that look like neck scarfs but have an in-built computer that checks whether or not you've crashed. If you are in the process of crashing, it effectively blows up like a balloon and keeps your head safe. The manufacturers said that they couldn't sell their product in the US because US regulations dictated that it needed a chin strap. I did some googling and found that the helmet failed some safety tests. Is that the same thing as this chin strap thing? Do any of you know the company and the story here? 

&amp;#x200B;

For a bit of context: I am actually in favor of some regulation (particularly in the financial sector), but not this chin strap thing. Some regulations are good, some aren't. I would love some more examples of both cases regulation being good and bad. Luckily, I know there are plenty of left-wing people who love regulation and right wing people who hate it with a burning passion in this sub, so hopefully you all have some good examples, since I use this one all the time when talking about stupid regulations (though of course, there are some good ones.

11,"Have you changed your opinion on Trump being a fascist? And if so, what tipped the scale?","For a while I was more in favor of calling Trump a reactionary or conservative with fascistic tendencies, but in the past 2 years I've felt extremely comfortable labeling him a genuine fascist (particularly recently). What changed for me was recognizing that fascism isn't only when people start getting genocided, or when textbooks are rewritten for political purposed ([like Trump just announced he would start doing with his Patriotic Education initiative](https://www.npr.org/2020/09/17/914127266/trump-announces-patriotic-education-commission-a-largely-political-move)). Like, Hitler didn't just suddenly become a fascist only when he started exterminating the first Jews - there were many steps that he did before that, duh.

But I also feel like many people might have come around on this given the recent comments on not being willing to concede the upcoming election, or with the crackdown on protesters.

15,What gives you hope?,"Hello, this is my first time posting on this sub. I never really have been interested in politics as much as I have been since Obama, but exploring modern politics in an unbiased way with an intention to be well informed had opened my eyes to corruption, exploitation, lies, greed and systematic failings that shake me to my core whenever I remember the state of our country.

For my background, I am 29 years old, married, and have a solidly middle-class job for a tech company. My family is wealthy and mostly conservatively leaning and I am college educated living near a city so I feel like I could have gone either way with my political leanings growing up, but actually taking the time to look at the facts and to really learn about how things work pushes me more and more to the left.

While Democrats certainly are not entirely absolved from corruption and exploitation, the severity of those issues seems heavily collate around Republicans. I'm not sure if Fox News is entirely the issue, but it baffles me how older generations can be so removed from caring about the fact that the electoral college is deeply flawed, gerrymandering is entirely undemocratic yet still legal, lobbying is basically legal bribery of elected officials and any semblance of Democracy left can be filibustered away. This is all to the detriment of my generation and the generations after me while the politicians trade power for money and their greed uses racism, xenophobia and religion to distract from the real problem with class division. Every day I think about the fact that because of the electoral college, someone from California has their vote matter less than someone from Iowa; that big oil paid politicians to ruin American climate change for money; that Republicans can literally lie to their base with absolutely no recourse, or that the integrity of information in this country has become so degraded that there must be a debate on whether 'facts' are true or not.

While my dad, and the parents of my colleagues keep voting for people like the Trump's and the Mitch McConnell's of this world, it's me, my wife, our friends, our neighbors and all the kids growing up today who are going to have to fix this damage, and that really scares me. The problem is that with how entrenched in political normality all these issues are, it seems like nothing short of a revolution would be enough to cause significant change to the system.

&gt;Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., announced a resolution Thursday that would broadly cancel federal student loan debt due to the coronavirus crisis.  

&gt;The resolution calls on President Donald Trump to take executive action to forgive up to $50,000 in debt for borrowers. 

&gt;Even before the coronavirus outbreak, college costs have been increasing significantly for years. As a result, student debt has reached record proportions, with more than $1.5 trillion in loans outstanding. 

&gt;Now, roughly 43 million adults currently have a federal student loan, according to the U.S. Department of Education.

&gt;But the burden is not shared equally among graduates. Studies show that women and Black students, particularly those from low- and moderate-income families, carry most of the nation’s debt.

33,Is my understanding of the Nordic Model correct?,"Hello,

I had a bit of a question about the Scandinavian system, specifically why it doesn't screw over the poor. So I did a bit of reading and found this:

[https://taxfoundation.org/bernie-sanders-scandinavian-countries-taxes/#:\~:text=In%20addition%20to%20income%20taxes,businesses%20throughout%20the%20production%20process](https://taxfoundation.org/bernie-sanders-scandinavian-countries-taxes/#:~:text=In%20addition%20to%20income%20taxes,businesses%20throughout%20the%20production%20process).

&amp;#x200B;

As I understand it, Scandinavian countries have a relatively flat income tax (in Sweden, people who make 1.5x the national average income pay the top tax rate), in fact it is flatter than here in the US. They also have a significant VAT. So, at first glance, this looks like it would screw over the poor yeah? I mean a flat income tax is basically regressive and a VAT makes goods more expensive. However, the key to the nordic model is that they reinvest that capital into assets that make the most expensive parts of a poor person's life cheaper or free as well as providing an extensive social safety net. So, sure the taxes may be high, but if your health insurance is free, business is booming (because of policies of Scandinavian governments that aren't relevant here), affordable housing is plentiful, education is good and free (universities are debt free, a fact that makes me, an american college student, very jealous). In short, the more expensive bits are made free or cheap at the cost of making the everyday more expensive. This tradeoff is good because it actually invests in poorer people (with good education, good healthcare, opportunities for entrepreneurship, ease of doing business, affordable housing, etc), and thus doesn't screw them over. Is this a correct understanding? Is there anything I'm missing? Thanks!",AskALiberal,1601302156

[The Compromise of 1787](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut_Compromise) is what set up our bicameral government here in the US.  One house (HoR) has proportional representation, the other (the Senate) has equal representation. The Senate was essentially created to placate the smaller populated states who feared being over-run by the larger populated states. 

Looking at that Wikipedia page, we see that James Madison and Alexander Hamilton were the biggest proponents of proportional representation. Hamilton even went so far as to say that states are really just artificial entities made up of individuals

As increasing numbers of Americans sort themselves geographically according to values/partisanship, this has created a problem of denser populated areas paying a larger proportion of the federal tax support, while the lesser dense areas get a more weighted say in how that money is spent.

The EC attempts to be proportional, but we know it's not, and a similar problem exists.  Getting rid of the EC would require a 2/3 majority of the Senate, which isn't going to happen given so many thinly populated states in the Senate. So in essence, the Senate has an overly-weighted say in the election of the Executive office.

Need I mention that the Senate also controls the Supreme Court?

80,Breonna Taylor - Who actually is responsible?,"I'm aware of the case and have read various articles, but from my point of view there is very important information that is missing.  I'm wondering if the info is out there and I just haven't seen it.

**Who directed the officers to that address?**  To me, that is where the criminal aspects lie.  There's also the important systemic issue about no-knock warrants.  I'm unaware if anything conclusive has been released about that.  I've heard multiple witnesses say they heard nothing, but I'm curious what body cameras will show before entering, or if they were even on at that point.  If they weren't on, that's another systemic issue that needs to be addressed.

I've heard comparisons to nurses saying if they went into a room and gave the wrong medicine they would be convicted.  I'm wondering if that is an apples to apples comparison.  If a doctor ordered a nurse to go into room 302 and give the wrong medicine, I would imagine the doctor would be convicted.  Maybe it's on the nurse to double check the records before administering anything.  I don't know what the process is.  Were the officers that went to Breonna's the same officers that made the decision to go to the wrong address?

I don't find the actions inside the place to be criminal.  They thought they were in a criminal's residence and they were being shot at.  The boyfriend didn't do anything criminal either.  The criminal acts were breaking into the wrong place.  I'm not saying to limit the charges to breaking and entering.  Include murder or manslaughter, but assign it to the person(s) who decided to break into the wrong place.  Not the person that fired his weapon.  Now, if it wasn't supposed to be a no-knock warrant and the officers didn't announce themselves, then they are deserving of charges even if someone else ordered them to that address.  And again, no-knock warrants should be eliminated, at least in the middle of the night.  And body cameras should always be on.",AskALiberal,1601146648

1,"Another Supreme Court Proposal, but Maybe Constitutional?","So this is very much in the spirt of not letting best be the enemy of better and I'd like your thoughts.

 • Maintain the status quo with no term limits

 • Uncap the number of Justices (maybe set a minimum)

 • Legislate that a President will nominate a justice every odd numbered year (regardless of the number of Justices on the court)

 • The Senate must vote on nominee within 100 days of nomination (or whatever is an appropriate time period)

 • The only time a President may present a nominee outside of the ""every odd numbered year"" rule is if the death or retirement of a Justice brings the court below minimum

 • By default, cases would be judged by a 3 or 5 judge panel. Chief Justice can figure out how they'd like to facilitate this.

 • This is very important - a certain number of Justices (less than half) can demand that the case be heard en banc (in front of all of the entire court). They can do this either after seeing the case or seeing what the panel is.

Here's why I like this.

 • I think this would work because it doesn't step on the Constitution in any way that I'm aware of

 • This sort of practice already works reasonably well for the lower courts

 • It ensures that new justices are seated in a predictable manner

 • The increased number of justices dilutes the influence of each one so the political fights become less extreme

 • The larger number of justices and ability to judge cases with a smaller number of justices will allow for a higher volume of these 9-0, 8-1 cases to be heard

 • The whole court can still judge the contentious cases

 • It's ""fair"". Justices can still be ""free of political influence"" (some sarcasm) because they aren't term limited but it still greatly suppresses the very chaotic nature of staffing the court now

2,Trump has officially picked Amy Coney Barrett to Fill Ginsburg’s Seat on the Supreme Court. Thoughts?,"[NYT:](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/25/us/politics/amy-coney-barrett-supreme-court.html?referringSource=articleShare)

&gt;WASHINGTON — President Trump has selected Judge Amy Coney Barrett, the favorite candidate of conservatives, to succeed Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and will try to force Senate confirmation before Election Day in a move that would significantly alter the ideological makeup of the Supreme Court for years.

&gt;Mr. Trump plans to announce on Saturday that she is his choice, according to six people close to the process who asked not to be identified disclosing the decision in advance.

&gt;As they often do, aides cautioned that Mr. Trump sometimes upends his own plans. But he is not known to have interviewed any other candidates and came away from two days of meetings with Judge Barrett this week impressed with a jurist he was told would be a female Antonin Scalia, referring to the justice she once clerked for.

&gt;The president’s political advisers hope the selection will energize his conservative political base in the thick of an election campaign in which he has for months been trailing former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., his Democratic challenger. But it could also rouse liberal voters afraid that her confirmation could spell the end of Roe v. Wade, the decision legalizing abortion, as well as other rulings popular with the political left and center.

&gt;The nomination will kick off an extraordinary scramble by Senate Republicans to confirm her for the court in the 38 days before the election on Nov. 3, a scenario unlike any in American history. While other justices have been approved in presidential election years, none has been voted on after July. Four years ago, Senate Republicans refused to even consider President Barack Obama’s nomination to replace Justice Scalia with Judge Merrick B. Garland, announced 237 days before Election Day, on the grounds that it should be left to whoever was chosen as the next president.

In fact, we should all be talking about this. They just don’t care if Black people (among other groups) live. They don’t. They’ll say “insert name” shouldn’t have resisted or done this or that, and no matter what they ALWAYS bring up the criminal record of the person. Why? I knew they were callous, but I thought they’d be fazed if the victim wasn’t a criminal and didn’t do anything wrong. But no, they just don’t care. Case in point; they’ve mostly stayed quiet about the Breonna Taylor Case, but seem to have gone mask off since the announcement. Most of them blame her boyfriend. Ok, I think that’s ignorant but it’s understandable. But some of them, like Charlie Kirk, have gone as far as to smear her as a drug trafficker when there’s no evidence that she was. That’s probably what most of them will think. They are pond scum. George Floyd was the only case they seemed kind of disturbed by, and that lasted like two weeks.  What other reason is there for them to behave like this? What other reason is there for them to love police so much?

Personally, I enjoy conspiracy theories, more as a form of entertainment than anything.  Recently, it seems there’s been a pattern of labeling any questioning of mainstream narratives as conspiracies.  This seems odd to me, as the Left typically has a distrust of authority and is critical of those in power.  A good example would be COVID.  There seems to be almost a cult mentality around “trusting the experts” as if no one is allowed to question the information surrounding the pandemic.  I work in healthcare, and I understand it can be frustrating to have your years of education and experience dismissed by some idiot who read a Mommy Blog.  However, it strikes me as odd that people become so angry when anyone even suggests that Corona may not be as serious as it’s made out to be.  I wear my mask and don’t complain, it’s better to be safe than sorry, but I do occasionally have doubt.

By looking at how our government has lied to us in the past about a myriad of different situations, I don’t think it’s insane to suspect they could do so again.

23,What do you think of Kelo v New London? Was it a good Law? Bad? Will the new Court revisit? Reverse it?,"Generic wiki link:

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelo_v._City_of_New_London](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelo_v._City_of_New_London)

&gt; Kelo v. City of New London, 545 U.S. 469 (2005), was a case decided by the Supreme Court of the United States involving the use of eminent domain to transfer land from one private owner to another private owner to further economic development. In a 5–4 decision, the Court held that the general benefits a community enjoyed from economic growth qualified private redevelopment plans as a permissible ""public use"" under the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment.[1]

Quotes from opinions:


Kennedy majority opinion:

A court confronted with a plausible accusation of impermissible favoritism to private parties should [conduct]... a careful and extensive inquiry into 'whether, in fact, the development plan [chronology]

[1.] is of primary benefit to... the developer... and private businesses which ""may"" eventually locate in the plan area...

[2.] and in that regard, only of incidental benefit to the city...'""

Kennedy is also interested in facts of the chronology which show, with respect to government,

[3.] awareness of... depressed economic condition and evidence corroborating the validity of this concern...

[4.] the substantial commitment of public funds... before most of the private beneficiaries were known...

[5.] evidence that [government] reviewed a variety of development plans...

[6.] [government] chose a private developer from a group of applicants rather than picking out a particular transferee beforehand and...

[7.] other private beneficiaries of the project [were]... unknown [to government] because the... space proposed to be built [had] not yet been rented...[8]

________________

O’Conner dissent:

Any property may now be taken for the benefit of another private party, but the fallout from this decision will not be random. The beneficiaries are likely to be those citizens with disproportionate influence and power in the political process, including large corporations and development firms.[9]

_____________

Thomas dissent:

This deferential shift in phraseology enables the Court to hold, against all common sense, that a costly urban-renewal project whose stated purpose is a vague promise of new jobs and increased tax revenue, but which is also suspiciously agreeable to the Pfizer Corporation, is for a 'public use.'[11]

....

Something has gone seriously awry with this Court's interpretation of the Constitution. Though citizens are safe from the government in their homes, the homes themselves are not.[12]

....

Allowing the government to take property solely for public purposes is bad enough, but extending the concept of public purpose to encompass any economically beneficial goal guarantees that these losses will fall disproportionately on poor communities. Those communities are not only systematically less likely to put their lands to the highest and best social use, but are also the least politically powerful.[13]",AskALiberal,1601048261

25,Can someone explain the emphasis on race to me?,"I've never really understood how other liberals feel about this issue, which can be a bit taboo to discuss in person, so I'm really hoping that someone can explain it to me.  I'm not asking you to convince me, but I've never really understood the emphasis on race (generally meaning black-white) that's coming to dominate left wing politics especially among younger people.  There seems to be a tendency to want to redirect discussions of most social and economic issues towards race, and I just don't get it.

We can start with police misconduct.  Police misconduct should horrify everyone, and it disproportionately affects black people.  But it doesn't only affect black people -- people misconduct can and has affected people of every race, so why orient the movement around race instead of around the problem of police misconduct? Shouldn't we equally concerned whenever anyone gets shot by the police? If we fix the problem of police misconduct overall, then it's solved for everyone.

Or take a lot of debates about poverty/education/etc.  Black people are disproportionately likely to live in poverty, and black children are disproportionately likely to attend low quality schools.  But again, white/Asian/hispanic/indigenous people can also live in poverty and can also attend crappy schools.  So why don't we try to do something about poverty and schools generally? Why should it be of greater concern that a black child lives in poverty than that a white child does? 

Or affirmative action.  I value diversity, and I think that people who have come from disadvantaged backgrounds deserve a leg up.  But why do we define diversity and disadvantage in terms of color? There are black people who have had every conceivable advantage in life (e.g., the Obama daughters) and white people who have had every conceivable disadvantage (born in poverty, disabled, single mother addicted to pills, add whatever you want).   To be sure, black people have faced more disadvantage *on average* but that's only true on average.  As for diversity, at least from the people I've known in my life, middle class suburban black people and middle class suburban white people don't introduce much diversity in terms of viewpoint, experience, etc., whereas, say, white people who grew up poor in a rural area have lived a totally different life.  And obviously people from other cultures bring the most diversity of all.  Even if we're limiting it to Americans, I've always found that first generation people whose parents come from other cultures bring the most ""diverse""/different perspective.

Sorry for the length of this, but I just can't wrap my mind around where people are coming from on these issues.  It seems so obvious to me that race (especially when that just means black/white and other groups are left in some ambiguous middle ground) is the wrong framework for thinking about and addressing these issues.  Can you help me see the other side?

I don't like problems without solutions, and I certainly don't like injustice without a path to justice. So, my question is do you support reparations? The argument is that certain groups in the US were repressed by red-lining, lack of access to loans and housing, and discrimination in education and jobs. This has resulted in widespread poverty in their communities. The poverty has lead to crime and a cycle of more poverty. So, to me the obvious solution is that they are owed reparations which are also their ticket out of the poverty and systemic racism that continues to this day.

Of course, I'm not sure how severe the systemic issues are today. If they are really as severe as some believe, I can't see how one couldn't support reparations? It seems like the only honest thing to do.

Some local governments have passed ""resolutions"" asking for the federal government to give reparations ([https://www.aboutamazon.com/working-at-amazon/diversity-and-inclusion/our-workforce-data](https://www.aboutamazon.com/working-at-amazon/diversity-and-inclusion/our-workforce-data)), but that seems kind of like a cop-out to me.

The cops are working in tandem with far-right militias to target peaceful protesters. The media is still playing both sides.

We understand that this country is in a state of turmoil. Between COVID-19, police brutality, and the looming election, there is a lot to feel upset, anxious, or frustrated about. These feelings do not excuse or permit comments promoting violence.

Going forward, we will be issuing a temporary ban for a first offense. If a user persists, they will receive a permanent ban. This is non-negotiable. Egregious offenses will be met with a permanent ban, first offense or not.

We ask that you use the report function if you see this behavior in our community. Reddit has banned entire subreddits for not properly moderating in these instances. We take this seriously and hope that you do too.

To that end, I don’t think going on witch-hunts for any and all possibly racist people is productive.  In fact, I think it’s more for the benefit of people being able to feel good about themselves because they “aren’t an evil Nazi piece of shit”.  As racial issues have received increasing attention over the past months, things have become absurd.  I’d almost argue that it is making people MORE racist than before.

I am a conservative who formerly supported BLM. However, after numerous demonstrations of BLM destroying the property of innocent people (who might even have agreed with them to begin with) and intimidating people, it seems shameful to support them in their current form.

Furthermore I thin MLK or civil rights leaders of the past would be completely ashamed of what's happening. I just can't bring myself to support it any further. Police reform and other things need to improve for african americans, but this is not the way.

68,Which of these judges do you think Trump is going to pick for the Supreme Court: Amy Coney Barrett or Barbara Lagoa?,"Amy Coney Barrett could motivate the evangelicals to vote, while Lagoa could be useful in securing the Cuban-American vote in Florida.


Some highlights of Amy Coney Barrett’s judicial record:

&gt;[... In one, the full appeals court declined to review a panel decision that blocked from taking effect an Indiana parental-consent law for minors seeking abortions. The law on this has been fairly clear, for decades: It is constitutional for states to require that minors seeking abortions obtain parental consent. However, such laws must provide what is known as a judicial bypass, allowing the minor to demonstrate that she is mature enough to make the decision on her own or that an abortion would be in her best interest.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/09/20/amy-coney-barretts-judicial-record-should-alarm-liberals/?utm_source=reddit.com)

&gt; Notwithstanding this settled law, Indiana enacted a parental-consent law that mandated that the parent be informed of the planned abortion unless the judge further decided that it would not be in the minor’s “best interests.” A district judge blocked the law, and a three-judge appeals court panel agreed. The panel, splitting two to one, noted the “serious risk that prior notice, instead of giving parents an opportunity to offer wise counsel, will actually give parents an opportunity to exercise a practical veto, preventing the pregnant minor from actually exercising the constitutional right the juvenile court has allowed her to exercise.” 

&gt;To take one other hot-button example, in 2018, gun rights groups were concerned about Barrett’s blank slate on the issue. Now they have before them a 2019 case involving a Wisconsin man, convicted of felony mail fraud, who claimed that federal and state laws prohibiting felons from possessing firearms went too far in his case, without any indication that he posed a danger. Two Republican appointees upheld the laws. Barrett dissented, saying that denying arms to all nonviolent felons treats the Second Amendment as a “second-class right.”

&gt;The Miami-born judge played a role in decisions limiting felon voting rights, ousting former Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel from office, and blocking Miami Beach’s efforts to raise the city’s minimum wage. 

&gt;Working as a pro bono lawyer, she served on the legal team representing the Miami relatives of Elián González, who was at the center of an international child custody case that dominated headlines two decades ago.

&gt;Her public statements show that she values a strict analysis of the law’s original intent over a legal philosophy that calls for empathy in arriving at a just decision.

69,I have a few questions for you concerning the SCJ drama,"I know these types of questions have been asked a ton, but I haven't found posts specifically addressing these points.

So, firstly, I fully understand the criticisms of McConnel saying that the senate should wait until after the election to vote in a judge. It's stupid, because it's clearly just trying to justify the senate waiting on a conservative judge, and no one should've believed for a second that this was supposed to set some kind of precedent that they'd follow in the future. But the senate has that power and is allowed to use it, its just that the justification was an obvious façade. I'm confused, because it seems a lot of democrats are conflating the justification (which is stupid) and the act of delaying a vote (which is allowed) and saying that republicans are somehow threatening institutions. It seems to me that democrats are *really* just upset about losing political power, and the talking points are, like McConnel's justification, a façade. Thoughts?

Secondly, it's strange to me that democrats think that, because McConnel's justification was stupid and, apparently, super threatening to our democracy, that democrats now have a right to break down our institutions even more by packing the court. Again, the senate hasn't done anything they aren't allowed to do, so does McConnel saying something dumb mean that democrats can abuse power in this way? I'd like to note that democrats have been playing with the idea of abolishing the senate and electoral college, as well as making DC and Puerto Rico states, all because this would give them more of a majority rule over red areas. So when they say that McConnel's justification greenlights another complete institutional change in favor of democratic power, I just can't help but think that some democrats are ready to pounce on any opportunity to gaslight and say that republicans are trying to break down institutions in order to justify doing just that.

Thirdly, I've also seen many people saying that RBG's final wish should be respected, and that republicans are immoral for opposing it. In what world does a SC judge get to make a final wish and have it upheld? What kind of precedent are *democrats* setting here? If Clarence Thomas makes a wish on his deathbed that he must be replaced by a different (republican) president, are democrats really going to go along with it?

I'd like to close by clarifying that I don't know much about the record of the two parties concerning institutional breakdown or the contradicting of norms, so I'm not making the case that republicans are somehow better at upholding these.

In life, things are rarely black and white, and taking the time to understand WHY a problem exists and delving to its source is something I think the Left does well.  This is particularly true of science based legislation.  And honestly I think these are something most Americans can get behind.

My issue is that The Left seems to have an optics, or PR problem.  Whenever I’m browsing Reddit or talking to a more liberal friend, their entire worldview seems to consist of a list of complaints that they place on the shoulders of others to solve.  There’s always a “boogeyman”, whether it’s the rich, the far-right, the police, the president, racists, the list goes on and on.  And while much of their criticisms of some of these groups may be quite valid, I think it comes off as off-putting to a lot of more “middle of the road” people.

82,"Biden Supporters: I'm struggling with some aspects of the Biden campaign, can I ask you guys some questions?","Hi all,

I  supported Bernie Sanders in both the '16 and '20 primaries. I was  heartbroken when he lost. I'm a self identified socialist, leftist,  and/or progressive, depending on the context. Biden was close to the  bottom of my preferences for who would win the nomination. I'm sure to a  lot of you that raises alarm bells so I want to get this out of the  way: **I am absolutely voting for Biden/Harris when I get my ballot and I sincerely hope he wins.**

\--

Having  said that, I have some worries. So I'm hoping to get the perspective of  some of y'all who don't share those worries and have more enthusiasm  for him. I promise I'm asking in good faith and I don't mean to offend  or come across as combative. So, here goes:

**1) How likely do you think it would be that a President Biden will follow through on his promises to progressives?**

A lot of us on the left were very disappointed in the Obama administration. Our perception was that he [campaigned as a progressive and governed as a moderate](https://www.npr.org/2013/01/05/168696568/obamas-on-again-off-again-relationship-with-progressives),  and that he was either unwilling or unable to follow through on some of  his more progressive policy pitches. Biden's policy platform is I think  pretty encouraging. I think his climate change plan in particular is  pretty good. But given his more conservative legislative record why  should I believe he intends to follow through on any of this? Even if he  does intend to, how will he actually accomplish this?

**2) What will a Biden/Harris administration do to prevent a second Donald Trump?**

From  my perspective, the future even if Biden wins isn't particularly  bright. He'll likely face an extraordinarily obstructive Republican  party in Congress, even if Dems take the senate. The Supreme Court is  very likely going to be controlled by conservatives for the forseeable  future. We're facing an unprecedented health crisis and an economic  disaster. Inequality will continue to be extraordinarily high. I think  there will continue to be more political violence and environmental  disasters. If Trump was able to scapegoat immigrants and Muslims and use  them to appeal to understandably angry and disillusioned people, what  will prevent someone like Trump from doing so in 2024?

**3) If Trump tries of steal the election, do you think the Biden team will put up a real fight?**

I'd argue that the 2000 election was [stolen by the Republicans and the Bush team.](https://theintercept.com/2018/11/10/democrats-should-remember-al-gore-won-florida-in-2000-but-lost-the-presidency-with-a-preemptive-surrender/)  A conservative Supreme Court helped them do so. If Trump does something  similar, do you think Biden will concede as Gore did? What recourse  will Biden have? What do you think he'll do if the election's legitimacy  is seriously undermined (say for example mass numbers of ballots being  'lost' in the mail) and Biden loses?",AskALiberal,1600873935

84,"Do you think a confirmation of a new SCOTUS justice before the election, followed by a Biden and Democrat Senate Majority win in 2020 would make Democrats less likely to vote in 2022 midterms?","Ok, hear me out. So it's pretty clear that, despite RBG's passing, and Republicans willingness to confirm a new justice before the election, most moderate Democrats are against court packing. In the likely event that Biden wins with the Democrats also having a Congressional majority, potential new legislation such as ACA expansion and a Green New Deal (even if it's not as ambitious as AOC and Markey's) would be declared unconstitutional or heavily neutered by the 6-3 conservative majority in the court. Since court packing is pretty much off the table, Democrats are out of luck in passing any liberal legislation. This might discourage Democratic voters to vote in the 2022 or 2024 elections seeing that no change can be done because of the conservative SCOTUS, as well as encourage Republicans to vote in those elections so they can ""get stuff done"" and not worry about SCOTUS overruling them.

Do you also think Biden needs to be open to court packing, or other Supreme Court reform in order for him or another Democrat to survive a 2024 election?

1. When fighting an incumbent in a close race, you want to help people along to vote against the candidate that they voted for before. Take away the ""yeah trump failed COVID but abortion"" issue. 
2. The ""fight"" over SCOTUS is a losing proposition for Democrats. Swing voters don't care about this issue. If they did they would not be swing voters. 
3. This distracts from the most important winning issue for Biden, COVID. We don't want to waste a month debating it and still et the same result. 
4. So you rush the process (which is inevitable anyway), while always reminding the American people that Republicans are liars and hypocrites. Then you get back to COVID. All day/all night. It would sound like this. 

""The Republicans told Americans that you can't seat a justice in an election year. Now they are doing just that. They lied plain and simple. They always lie. Just like they lied about COVID and in doing so tanked the economy. At this point we are not going to waste the American people's time fighting a nomination that Republicans are going to go through with. This is exactly why Republicans must go. We must vote them out because they are liars and those lies killed 200,000 people, destroyed our economy (again) and it is only going to get worse.""

""**The median real income for full-time workers with a four-year degree has grown from $55,000 a year in 1975 to $72,000 in 2018. But that still falls far short of the $120,000 they’d be earning had incomes grown with per capita GDP.** Even at the 90th percentile, a college educated full-time worker making $191,000 a year is earning less than 78 percent what they would have had inequality held constant.""


""The reality is that American workers have never been more highly educated. In 1975, only 67 percent of the adult US workforce had a high school education or better, while just 15 percent had earned a four-year college degree. By 2018, 91 percent of adult workers had completed high school, while the percentage of college graduates in the workforce had more than doubled to 34 percent. **In raw numbers, the population of adult workers with a high school education or less has fallen since 1975, while the number of workers with a four-year degree has more than quadrupled.**""

""**We chose to cut taxes on billionaires and to deregulate the financial industry. We chose to allow CEOs to manipulate share prices through stock buybacks, and to lavishly reward themselves with the proceeds.** We chose to permit giant corporations, through mergers and acquisitions, to accumulate the vast monopoly power necessary to dictate both prices charged and wages paid. **We chose to erode the minimum wage and the overtime threshold and the bargaining power of labor. For four decades, we chose to elect political leaders who put the material interests of the rich and powerful above those of the American people.**

13,Would it not be a smarter play for Trump to wait on filling RGB’s seat?,"Republicans can push a nomination through in the lame duck session the same as they can now. Waiting until after the election could provide him with the following:

1) Waiting until after the election “out of respect for historical norms” could sway voters who personally benefit from his policies but are considering voting against him because he’s such an awful, divisive person. The folks who are looking for any excuse to vote for him that will let them sleep at night. I used quotes above because he obviously doesn’t respect anyone or anything and would just be doing this to win the election.

2) In 2016, the idea of a conservative filling an empty SCOTUS seat was a highly motivating factor for Trump voters. Filling the seat now could be viewed as blowing his wad early. Not only would a 3rd Trump SCOTUS seat be a huge reason to turn out Republican-leaning voters, it would be robbing Democrats of the visceral calls to avenge their beloved justice.

3) Conservatives could claim the high moral ground for the first time in a long time. Even if for the wrong reasons, choosing not to fill the seat right now is the right thing to do. It would be the closest thing they have to making Trump seem presidential and the first time the party hasn’t looked like opportunistic snakes in a long time.",AskALiberal,1600734022

31,Why do liberals tend to be against Nuclear Power? Questions on the green new deal.,The point of the green new deal is to have zero carbon emissions right? Why does it ban nuclear power as well? Nuclear gives zero carbon emissions. We already get more of our power from nuclear than wind and solar. Solar energy produces 300 times the waste as nuclear.

It seems nuclear is the best way to get to zero carbon emissions the fastest. So why is the green new deal and many liberals against it??,AskALiberal,1600703062
32,The electoral college,"With the election coming up, (oh boy who’s ready for that shit show?) we have come back to discussions about the lovely Electoral College. As an argument from dissidents to it, it devalues the vote of individuals who live in 10 million population states, giving those who live in the ‘flyover’ states a greater weight in the election. The argument from proponents is that half the US population lives in basically 6 states, which is true and somewhat astonishing. 

I am here to propose and get critiques on a middle ground, keeping the electoral college with small changes to make it more impacted by the people. My change is that, instead of the electoral college going specifically off of statewide popular vote, it works off of counties. We apply the same math to determine a state’s EC vote count to each individual county inside the state, and take the individual counties EC votes and apply them to candidates. This would greatly increase the individual’s impact on the election. The biggest drawback I can think of is how to deal with 10 counties in a state with 3 electoral votes situation, but that may be solved by the same distributing votes system, take the least populous counties and combine them with more populous counties until you have a group with 1 EC vote. 

This change means that highly populous areas like San Francisco have a large amount of electoral votes when compared to less populous areas like the middle of Oklahoma. It increases the individual’s vote value by making the popular vote inside of each county the deciding factor of who to send that counties EC vote to, which gives more power to choose for individuals in places like Houston, TX where the city is blue it the state is red.

What are your thoughts on a system like this? Is it a good middle ground, can it be improved?",AskALiberal,1600696864

36,Why do you think American culture is so fixated on (rugged) masculinity and toughness?,"The American aesthetic is one that feels less feminine than other countries. American football is a rougher game than soccer. Beer is the culturally endorsed drink instead of something more elegant like wine. Guns are more popular here than many other countries, while theater and other forms of ""high culture"" are less popular. There's less collectivism and compassion (including less of a social safety net than elsewhere), and more overly rugged individualism and chastising unlucky people as ""losers"" who ""deserve it"". Corporal punishment is legal (even in schools in some states), and accepted by many Americans. But regarded as barbaric in many other countries. One's ability to withstand uncomfortable physical sensations is celebrated in the U.S. Moreso between men, but also overall (events like the ""ice bucket challenge"" show the latter). Children who are ""troopers"" and tolerate discomfort are the gold standard. The military is more celebrated than in other countries. Police officers are way more armed than elsewhere and are expected to be tough and aggressive.

In contrast to other countries, American society hates femininity in men. Rather, American men have to conform into a rigid box where they can't really show any femininity. Men in Europe, Japan, South Korea, or Australia can dress with more style, enjoy more feminine things, and get through life without walking on eggshells around not being masculine and having their ""man card"" taken away. Sitcoms have taken note of this with their ""European Man Purse"" and ""European Speedo"" jokes. 

In contrast to the above, American women seem to have more encouragement to embrace masculine things than women in other industrialized countries. American women can pull off wearing suits and shave their heads without raising too many eyebrows. Whereas that would be harder to imagine in other countries. Women's sports is also more embraced in the U.S than elsewhere (FIFA women's world cup results show this). American parents also view it as a positive bonus if their daughter turns out to be a ""tomboy"".

In the two presidential elections I have been eligible to vote, I have voted for one democrat and one republican nominee. I would also like to preface that **I am not looking to argue about any of my political stances in this particular thread**\- I just want help in pinpointing where I lay on the political spectrum, and a combination of your assistance and the physical act of writing this will surely aid in that.

According to [Pew Research](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2020/08/13/important-issues-in-the-2020-election/), these are the most pressing issues of the 2020 election. I'll start with a number, 1-5 on how important I deem the particular issue is. For example, I don't particularly care about penguins in Antarctica, so I would put: 

\&gt;1. Penguins in Antarctica.

The actual list

5. Economy. I personally think that the economy is more important than many other issues on this list. That said, I am a fan of laissez-faire capitalism and think that privatization is important for competition and personal growth. I am not a fan of handouts and likewise I am not a fan of welfare because I think it promotes laziness. I think that just because someone is well off does not mean we are entitled to their money, and I think that we should just lower taxes overall. 

4. Healthcare. I withdrew from my medical and doctorate programs, so this one kind of hits home for me. I personally do not think that healthcare is a human right. Things like food and water and walking are all human rights, but healthcare is so broad and hard to define. I don't think I am entitled to cosmetic surgery or organ transplantation or fertility treatment and that doctors or the government need to supply me as such. 

On the ACA, I really don't think it was helpful. It kind of left the working middle-class in the dust, and I think people only started approving of it once it became known that the Donald was trying to replace it. 

Do I think some government intervention is necessary? Yes, because the healthcare system as is a smoldering dumpster fire. How should it be fixed? Not sure. 

4. Supreme Court Appointments. I hate that this is so partisan and political, because it really shouldn't be. When I think of Supreme Court Appointments for the 2020 nomination, I think of the Nuclear Option and RBG's replacement. On the one hand, Democrat senate leader Harry Reid pushed for the Nuclear Option in 2013 when Democrats had the Senate majority, so it seems strange now that Democrats are crying foul when Republicans are using the same policy against them. On the other hand, Garland was rejected by Republicans because it was an election year, and that same scenario is happening now. I think Democrats would have appointed Garland had they had senate majority. There is hypocrisy on both sides, like most things in politics. On whether RBG should be replaced before the election or after it, I'm neutral. I don't think I would disapprove of either scenario if either scenario happened. 

5. Coronavirus Outbreak. The pandemic is pretty bad. In addition to the lost lives and lasting chronic effects, the economy has suffered greatly from it. I think politicizing the usage of masks was a bad thing by the current executive administration, but I also think the opposition wouldn't have done any better. [Nancy Pelosi](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-53994209) was blatantly breaking mask protocol when she has been so vocal about her disapproval of the administration's handling of the pandemic. I think both sides suck. 

On a tangent, I hate how scandals are blown so out of proportion for the Republican side but quickly hushed on the Democrat side, regardless of severity. The whole Nancy Pelosi hair salon mask thing was hushed as a set-up in like 5 minutes. Now imagine that Nancy Pelosi was a rapist and the hair-salon owner was a rape victim. She was caught in the act and is purely victim-shaming. I hate how the media tells you how to think instead of just presenting facts for independent analysis. 

5. Violent Crime. I still like the idea behind them, and I used to support BLM and similar equality movements, but I definitely do not support these groups now after all of the protests and riots. We are in a pandemic, and the huge gatherings that the protests and riots in blue cities have become are just cesspools of Covid that have surely contributed greatly to the pandemic and infection cases. How can you consciously have mass gatherings then blame the administration for not doing enough to combat the pandemic and quell the riots when the protests almost invariably lead to said riots? 

5+. Foreign Policy. I think the most important thing in the world right now is foreign policy and the trade war with China. If China wins the trade war, there's no reason the US wouldn't go through an economic breakdown akin to the Cold War's USSR. Sure, we have a huge deficit, but it doesn't mean anything because we have a larger economy and military than the rest of the world. The US is stuck in its role as world bully, because if we stop doing that then the deficit doesn't just become a word. 

I'm not a fan of isolationism, because there is so much Anti-American sentiment around the world that I think it's too late to switch course. I don't think we should lower military spending, and I think the US should police the world. 

I kind of wish Trump would stop calling allied leaders idiots in phone calls. 

3. Gun Policy. I think that whatever we've got going on right now isn't working because of all of the mass shootings. There should be more background checks and mental health tests in gun restrictions, but I also think that if you are sane and law abiding, nothing should stop you from having a gun.   

1. Race and Ethnic Equality. I touched on this in the violent crime section already. I think there should be racial ethnic equality, which both political sides generally agree on (on how to get there and whether their supporters agree with that sentiment is where they differ...). I think other issues are more important in the current political climate. To me, the economy and war is more important than if some random Joe on the street calls me a racial slur or treats me differently because of my race on any given Tuesday. 

3. Immigration. I'm a first-gen immigrant. My parents immigrated legally (granted, they got some leeway from the Chinese Student Protection Act of 1992 \[thanks, Bush!\]. Great policy by the way. Let's steal all of China's best students and intellectuals. I wouldn't even be alive without it because of the One Child Policy.), and I think that more stringent immigration policies are important. This is due to the US having an incredibly high standard of living and very high immigration rates, so we can afford to be more selective in who we let into the country. As harsh as it may sound, allowing non-skilled workers who are usually poor into the country will generally increase crime. 

2. Economic Inequality. Like I said before, I believe in the free-market. I don't believe in handouts. If an inequality exists, it usually exists for a personal reason. 

3. Climate Change. I think it exists and that it's an important issue, but there's a fine balance between economy and environment that has to be balanced. If the sky is literally a polluted smog and it hurts to breathe, tone down the carbon emissions and pollution. If switching to renewable sources makes the US economy noncompetitive, hold off until that becomes a non-issue or the renewable sources don't make it noncompetitive. 

4. Abortion. If the technology exists for it, let's use it. Abortion prevents a child from being raised in unideal circumstances when the parents do not want said child. An argument I hear a lot is that unborn children are precious because of what they could turn out to be, but I would much rather not harm someone \[that wants an abortion but cannot have one\] that is already established to be good and a productive member to society than someone that by definition and technicality is unproven. It's like a prospect in sports. I'd rather have Mike Trout (the parent in this analogy) on my baseball team than have an unproven prospect (the unborn child).

78,Why is Twitter not seen as negatively as Facebook,"One thing I noticed during the democratic primaries was how there seemed to be a separate and very influential war at play happening inside the Twitter bubble. Incendiary opinions about candidates would get spread like wildfire turning into retweets turning into hashtags and somehow making it to news articles. It just seems like Twitter has more power of spreading disinformation because of the sheer nature of it. And the fact that journalists interact in that space and see extreme opinions of a small subset highlighted by the Twitter algorithm taken by them as a metric of the discourse happening around the country and writing about it to then present it to the general public just seemed wild to me. 

And I’m not trying to defend Facebook I just feel I’m hearing more voices reprehending facebook for contributing to the spreading  of misinformation  while Twitter flies under the radar being guilty of basically the same lack of accountability on what I feel is an even more toxic environment. 

In retrospect my question is also based on what I see on Facebook and Twitter and Reddit which is not representative of the general public but that’s kind of my point. I feel Twitter is more influential cuz it influences journalists themselves.",AskALiberal,1600566140
79,How do we “fast track” educate on cognitively difficult concepts like white privilege?,"I’m not quite sure how to articulate myself, but for a long time I have felt like a large part of the political divide is that certain “leftist” social justice initiatives take some time to understand. And while they are ultimately factually, morally correct, they don’t immediately make sense if you are confronted with or encountering them for the first time. 

The concept of white privilege is a good example. When most people who’ve never heard of the term before are confronted with it, the common response is something like “I may be white, but I’m not privileged! I worked hard, I was/am poor”, and so on. It’s not something you “get” immediately, it’s a bit complex and takes some reading, reflection, and understanding. But it’s ultimately correct. 

I am concerned seeing the right interpret these kinds of concepts as false and indoctrination, or a message that we should hate white people. That’s absolutely false. But since these concepts take time to sink in, and take willing minds...

&amp;#x200B;

So, I began lurking both askaliberal and askaconservative. My experience in the conservative group has been mostly respectful - there wasn't much of the mudslinging toward the democrats, contrary to what we see in mass media punditry and messaging. However, when I have asked questions or commented in the liberal section, I have experienced noticeably more ire for deviating from some of the more commonly held opinions. It seems as if introducing nuance or concession that doesn't favor the liberal ideology can be seen as making excuses for racism or even being racist, for example. When instead, I might be attempting to engage a topic or opinion with respect to its complexity and to separate it partially from, say, binary values. I had tried to respond to some people with elaboration, (bad) attempts at analogy, and hypotheticals, but after some time started to get impatient with the dismissals and/or insults.   


To be honest, I reacted pretty emotionally to this board (while trying not to show it THAT much). I felt exasperated in the way that I guess conservatives sometimes do and I think that it's making me yet more conciliatory toward the republican party.

A Capitalist society with a healthy set of safety nets to counteract the ill effects of Capitalism.

But this past four years has put my mind into what would be considered a quite radical position just a few years ago.

I believe that police brutality(regardless of race) should be combated...and the group that is most active in that pursuit is BLM....so I wholeheartedly support them.

I believe that climate change is real and needs to be addressed in a very real way...that puts me in a somewhat tenuous alignment with the Green New Deal....I also think that wages need to go up across the board and that upper level management has gotten too wealthy and too powerful.

I think that the best way to grow our economy is to put more real money in working people’s hands. So,(once again) I suppose higher wages and reducing burdens upon the working people(single payer healthcare/ affordable college education). Or... even a robust public opinion that forces private insurance to compete and lower costs to the consumer.


Well, pretty much everything I believe in has been thwarted by the right, who believe that pretty much everything should be purely for profit and that working people’s struggles don’t really matter.

I have heard lie after lie for the GOP’s Messiah(Trump) for the better part of 4 years. 

I have seen him deploy more drone strikes in his 4 years than Obama did in 8 years, and his supporters claim that he is such a pacifist. 

I have seen him repeatedly threaten to pull Federal funds from states simply on the basis of not supporting him.

I have seen him one day throwing nauseating praise at a member of his team, only to deny even knowing them when they get caught doing something shady and illegal.

I have watched his 2020 ads using doctored video of Biden saying...”if you vote for me,you taxes are going up”, when the truth of the matter is that unless you’re making over $400,000/year? You are safe.

But what REALLY put me into the realm of a “radical” is what happened today. Ruth Bader Ginsburg passed away and before her corpse got below 90 degrees, Mitch McConnell had put out a statement on how the Senate WILL bring up a vote to confirm whoever Trump nominates....after his long dissertation on how it wouldn’t be appropriate to bring Merrick Garland up for a vote.

This is the very definition of Tyranny and  hypocritical abuse of power. If there is ONE THING that you can point to that is the very definition of the “straw that broke the camel’s back”? This is it.

Surely, a third party vote in swing states can create a spoiler effect, but I personally don't think it's a good idea. Here's why:

1. Green Party voters aren't just leftier Democrats; if there was no Green Party or Green Party equivalent, they would just stay home.
2. Any third party voter who sees that Democrats took their preferred candidate off the ballot will just be disgusted by the fact and will certainly stay home or write in their preferred candidate.
3. It's bad optics and it's un-Democratic to take candidates off the ballot. Republicans and third-party voters are already angry about this, in good faith or otherwise.

34,How do reduced taxes cause business owners to invest more?,"I know the answer at face value is ""because they'll have more money.""

I'd like to say I'm a small business owner, but not an accounting expert.

Taxes are taken out after expenses. That means the higher expenses you have - and less gross - the less taxes you pay.

Let's look at some examples using *easy* (not real) numbers:

Example a

Gross: $100

Tax rate: 20%

Net income $80

Example b

Gross: 100

Tax rate: 40%

Net income $60

When the tax rate is higher it makes me want to put MORE money back into my business so I don't have to pay the higher tax rate. 

For every dollar that I don't spend I get taxed. I can either have 60% (gross minus tax rate) purchasing power if the money becomes mine, but I'll have 100% purchasing power if I reinvest it back into my business and don't pay taxes on it.

If I personally don't need the money, then I'll just put everything back into my business.",AskALiberal,1600457599

(Joe Biden and Harris currently have a 76 percent chance of winning the presidential race, according to our forecast.1)

&gt;Our Congressional model (our forecast for House races will be released soon) is largely the same as the version we built in 2018, which was quite accurate in predicting the number of Senate and House seats that each party would win. We’ve made a handful of changes since 2018, most of which were designed to create more consistency with our presidential forecast, including assuming that uncertainty is slightly higher this year because of an increase in mail voting under COVID-19.

It argued that because some of the founders of musical theory were racist, musical theory is therefore racist. Finally it argues that prior to the 1940's America, black Americans, though welcome to attend symphonies, were usually segregated and unable to participate in orchestras.

With my apologies for gross over-simplification, his claims are:

* Identity politics turned white working class people (both in Europe and the US) against the establishment, because while they struggled, the establishment was more vocal about lifting up *ethnic* minorities.
* Now, identity politics has shifted rightward. The resentment that drove Brexit, Trump, etc is similar to feelings in Russia that it was humiliated by NATO in the late 90s/2000s, or by China, once a great world power, then humiliated in the 20th century. The resentment of right-wing populism is similar, and has lead us to a system of competing resentment identities on the left and right.
* Fukuyama argues for diversity, but *integrated diversity*, where people of different backgrounds actually live and work close to another instead of in ""ethnic ghettos."" He also argues that, to an extent, immigrants should assimilate to at least certain aspects of the existing culture.

To remedy the politics of identity resentment, Fukuyama recommends:

* Universal health care and some modicum of income redistribution, to temper claims of gross inequality among both white and minority groups.
* Compulsory national services; either civil or military, to force people of different backgrounds to work together.
* Respect for the ""leading culture"" of a country by newcomers, combined with a liberal and welcoming (but controlled) immigration policy.
* An end to quotas and traditional affirmative action notions, in favor of more unity.

&gt;The U.S. should have enough Covid-19 vaccine doses for Americans to return to “regular life” by the third quarter of next year, the head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Wednesday. 

&gt;CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield told a Senate panel he expects vaccinations to begin in November or December, but in limited quantities with those most in need getting the first doses, such as health-care workers. He said it will take about “six to nine months” to get the entire American public vaccinated.


&gt;“If you’re asking me when is it going to be generally available to the American public so we can begin to take advantage of vaccine to get back to our regular life, I think we’re probably looking at third ... late second quarter, third quarter 2021,” he told the U.S. Senate Appropriations subcommittee on labor, health and human services, education, and related agencies.

&gt;Redfield said the Trump administration’s Covid-19 vaccine program Operation Warp Speed was unprecedented. He told lawmakers that a vaccine usually takes four to six years.

&gt;There are no approved vaccines for the coronavirus. Three drugmakers are currently in late-stage testing for potential vaccines and expect to know if they work by the end of the year.  

&gt;The U.S. government plans to transport the vaccine to distribution sites across the U.S. within 24 hours after the FDA grants an emergency authorization or approval, senior administration officials told reporters Wednesday morning. The government will use medical supply company McKesson as its main distributor for the vaccine.

92,How do I convince my dad to not vote for Trump,"I'll admit right off the bat that I don't know a whole lot about politics (hence why I'm here) and that I honestly hate talking about politics altogether but talking about this kind of thing is unavoidable nowadays. Personally speaking, I strongly believe Trump does more damage than good and that he's not fit to hold the power he has now, although I will admit that I'm not too thrilled about Biden either. I think it's pretty clear that he's the ""lesser evil"" (for lack of a better term) in this matter but I can't seem to convince my dad that this is true.

My dad is a pretty devout conservative but I firmly believe this is a matter of being heavily misinformed. He doesn't get any of his information from credible sources and primarily sticks to watching YouTube videos/rants as his primary source. He's already dropped the ""all lives matter"" bombshell on me a couple times, to which I quickly attempt to explain why that phrase is problematic (this is just a small insight to his social views). When it comes down to it, I strongly believe my dad has good intentions but is just very misinformed.

My plan is to eventually just have a long conversation with him about where he gets his information from as well as why his beliefs about Trump are flawed. At this point, I already planned out a few key talking points:

• Trump's overwhelming list of impeachable offenses

• Environmental damage caused by his policy making

• Blatant racism and social dividing

• Trump calling dead troops/soldiers ""losers"" and ""suckers"" (my dad is big on supporting the military so hopefully this will have some weight behind it)

• Defunding of the USPS and how it's essentially a violation of voting rights and democracy altogether

• Trump's Covid response and downplaying

I'm just looking for any additional information I can use to help convince him. All flaws aside, I still love the guy very much and I just want him to see the facts and make an informed decision. ",AskALiberal,1600281097

I was shocked by the video and even more shocked that apparently most people believe the police were in the right here. It’s a traffic stop at 3 AM for a wide left turn (cutting off the police car) and the police want to tow the guy’s car because his registration tags are two months out of date. He begs for a ticket so he can go home. They endlessly threaten him and then tase him, pepper spray him, and assault him for several minutes as he’s FUCKING BEGGING INTO HIS PHONE FOR HELP. Then he eventually shoots the two officers by surprise getting a gun from under his seat. 

Not only are most people saying the police were justified in how they acted, they say it’s proof that police were in the right to shoot Jacob Blake for reaching into his car. 

My first reaction was that it proves the people enforcing traffic shouldn’t be violent bullies with tools to hurt people into compliance. Nobody should be getting their car impounded over paperwork if we can help it, let alone people getting hurt and killed over it.

He wasn't able to pay for my wife to go to college or even afford books for her, so she got stuck with tons of college debt. Meanwhile a friend of my wife was a first generation Egyptian immigrant who qualified to have her college played for as well as her books and equipment meanwhile her parents ran two businesses. That it's not fair that he and his father fought in two wars and his family gets nothing. While an immigrant family can get a free ride.

My wife agrees with him and says we should take care of our own before we take care of immigrants legal or illegal. 

In a way I can see why this sounds messed up, I don't really know if I agree with giving immigrants free education but I'm ignorant of the reasons why this is allowed to happen. Or even how the laws work.  I'm not sure how to explain how even though this was the hand he was dealt with in life that he is still more privileged than others. And also that because he didn't experience privileges that it doesn't make it true for the majority.

* While fraud in voting by mail is far less common than innocent errors, it is vastly more prevalent than the in-person voting fraud that has attracted far more attention

* Voting by mail is now common enough and problematic enough that election experts say there have been multiple elections in which no one can say with confidence which candidate was the deserved winner.

* 3.9 million ballots requested by voters never reached them; that another 2.9 million ballots received by voters did not make it back to election officials; and that election officials rejected 800,000 ballots. That suggests an overall failure rate of as much as 21 percent.

* There is a bipartisan consensus that voting by mail, whatever its impact, is more easily abused than other forms. 

In July of this year, the NY Times published another article titled [""Voting by Mail Is Popular. So Is the False Idea That It’s Ripe for Fraud.""](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/31/us/politics/trump-mail-voting-fraud.html)

My opinions on the matter are as follows: 

On the one hand, if gun restrictions are very high, then only the people that want to use guns illegally will have guns, and fewer first responders (people already on the site of the shooting) with legal guns will be there to stop them.

On the other hand, if gun restrictions are laxer, then everyone including the people that want to use guns illegally will have guns. This may not stop the less mentally stable shooters, but there will be more people to stop anything that happens.

48,How much tax are you willing to pay ?,"A common argument that liberals make for increased Federal income tax is that taxes are the cost of living in a society and are used for schools,roads,firefighters,police, etc.

My interpretation of the view liberals hold is that these services as well as other entitlement programs will be massively improved by tax hikes. 
 
So my question to liberals is what is the maximum percent of marginal tax you are willing to pay for the tax bracket that you are in ?  To what extent are you willing to give your income up to solve societal problems ?

I actually saw Mr. Glenn speak at Governor Ted Strickland's inauguration and I remember watching his 1998 return to space on television, but I was too young to be keeping up with politics at the time. Since I haven't really studied the second half of the 20th century in depth, I'm finding it difficult to assess his Senate career.

For me personally it comes down to a few things:

• More transparency (via reporting and online archives) means that politicians can be held to a more strict standard by their constituents. Making a deal outside of the party makes the party look weak (Republican and Democratic Party alike).

• No common ground. As soon as an issue comes up the first party to jump to a decision usually forces the other to take the opposing position. There is very little grey area for these issues and if there is it’s downplayed a lot. 

• Cross Party Parties are down. This is just a funny one, but there was a news report about how Democrats and Republicans used to go to parties together more frequently in the past. A good example would be RBG and Scalia being good friends outside the Supreme Court. But in recent years that cross pollination has given way to a more clique atmosphere.

76,What do you think of Joe Biden's proposed assault weapons and magazine bans? He reiterated support for them yesterday on Twitter and has a number of details on his campaign site.,"Recent tweet about this:

https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1305300227721703424

&gt;Weapons of war have no place in our communities.

&gt;We need to ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines.

And for more details:

https://joebiden.com/gunsafety/

&gt;Get weapons of war off our streets. The bans on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines that Biden, along with Senator Feinstein, secured in 1994 reduced the lethality of mass shootings. But, in order to secure the passage of the bans, they had to agree to a 10-year sunset provision and when the time came, the Bush Administration failed to extend them. As president, Biden will:

&gt;* Ban the manufacture and sale of assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. Federal law prevents hunters from hunting migratory game birds with more than three shells in their shotgun. That means our federal law does more to protect ducks than children. It’s wrong. Joe Biden will enact legislation to once again ban assault weapons. This time, the bans will be designed based on lessons learned from the 1994 bans. For example, the ban on assault weapons will be designed to prevent manufacturers from circumventing the law by making minor changes that don’t limit the weapon’s lethality. While working to pass this legislation, Biden will also use his executive authority to ban the importation of assault weapons. 

&gt;* Regulate possession of existing assault weapons under the National Firearms Act. Currently, the National Firearms Act requires individuals possessing machine-guns, silencers, and short-barreled rifles to undergo a background check and register those weapons with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF). Due to these requirements, such weapons are rarely used in crimes. As president, Biden will pursue legislation to regulate possession of existing assault weapons under the National Firearms Act. 


&gt;* Buy back the assault weapons and high-capacity magazines already in our communities. Biden will also institute a program to buy back weapons of war currently on our streets. This will give individuals who now possess assault weapons or high-capacity magazines two options: sell the weapons to the government, or register them under the National Firearms Act.


&gt;* Reduce stockpiling of weapons. In order to reduce the stockpiling of firearms, Biden supports legislation restricting the number of firearms an individual may purchase per month to one.

There is more on the page. But, those are the bullet points underneath the assault weapons ban section.

Some questions to spark discussion (don't feel a need to answer all of them):

Thoughts on this and on the proposed details of its implementation? Which part do you agree with the most? Which part do you disagree with the most? Does this go far enough in your view? Not far enough?

81,Are we shifting to a Seventh Party System?,"For those that don't know. A party system is when two political ideologies go against each other. Over time these ideologies change as well as the dominate party which then leads into a new party system. So far the US has had six. They usually last about thirty to forty years, and one party usually dominates in that time period as well as an ideology. They're usually sparked by a certain president that might be seen as Revolutionary.

The first party system was the Federalists against the Democratic Republicans. Starting mainly with John Adams, but really didn't start until Jefferson.

The second started with Andrew Jackson with the Democrats against the Whigs up till the civil war. 

The third was started by Lincoln with the Northern Republicans against the Southern Democrats until the turn of the 20th century. 

The fourth was dominated by big corporate Republican interests and the rise of the middle class up until the great depression.

The fifth was dominated by New Deal Democrats beginning with FDR.

The sixth and current system happened either in the late sixties or nineteen eighty when the democratic coalition broke up and the south shifted to Republican and has been dominated by Reaganite Republicans ever since. 

Now it seems like we're due for a political ideological shift, but is one happening or are we still experiencing the same ideologies for the past thirty plus years? 

Arguments for: 
The Republican party has shifted under Trump from big business neoconservative to an isolationist nationalist party. While the Democrats are shifting from more liberal to a more fiscally conservative socially liberal party dominated by centrists Democrats and disenfranchised Republicans.

State party dominance is shifting. The south and states like Texas and Arizona are becoming more dominate by minority voters and will soon be voting for the Democratic party, while states in the rust belt will continue to shift right.

Arguments against:
Trump is just an outlier or just an extension of Reagan policies of little Government and Pro big business. Paul Ryan was a Reaganite Conservative that pushed forward Reagonomic policies just two years ago. The Democrats have always been the fiscally conservative and socially Liberal party of the past few decades so nothing has changed.

My opinion is that we may be in the process of a shift I can't say that what is happening currently is going to stick. Generally the dominant party of a shift is seen as pretty popular, and even though Trump has changed the Republican party it isn't popular. I feel that even though the Democratic party has shifted to the center it isn't popular either especially with younger more liberal voters so I don't see how as it stands it being the dominant party over the next few decades. I think the Democrats really need a FDR or Reagan figure to really shift the party system to a seventh. I thought Obama might have been that guy, but he didn't end up being a revolutionary.

Some juries have also refused to convict due to their own prejudices in favor of the defendant.

In the US pretty much anyone on a jury can also force a mistrial even if all other 11 members are in favor of conviction, since a unanimous decision is necessary to render a verdict. The prosecutor could of course take the case back to court, but most don't in the case of mistrials.

On the surface this SEEMS equitable, but we know it's not. This is in no way meant to benefit Trump. The left and the media haven't done him any favors in four years and they aren't about to start now. IMHO if they had any faith that Biden could pull off an election night win they wouldn't be pushing this 'wait and see' narrative at all. So does this mean that even the media, the party that's in bed with the left has zero faith their candidate can win a fair fight?

But don't worry! I'm not here to ask if you're upset with Trump. I know that there is literally nothing Trump could do that would upset you. So I'm just here to ask why Trump purposefully allowing a pandemic to get worse for political points is totally awesome and great actually!

India was not even called by that name in 1492; it was known as Hindustan. More likely, the word Indian comes from Columbus's description of the people he found here. He was an Italian, and did not speak or write very good Spanish, so in his written accounts he called the Indians, ""Una gente in Dios."" A people in God. In Dios. Indians. It's a perfectly noble and respectable word.

&gt;So let's look at this (censored), trendy b s phrase, Native Americans. First of all, they're not natives. They came over the Bering land bridge from Asia, so they're not natives. There are no natives anywhere in the world. Everyone is from somewhere else. All people are refugees, immigrants, or aliens. If there were natives anywhere, they would be people who still live in the Great Rift valley in Africa where the human species arose. Everyone else is just visiting.

37,Conservatives on Campus (I don’t think this is redux).,"I didn’t realize this sub existed but found it after doing a search for this question. If this is often asked, just let me know and I’ll expand my search.

I understand the prevailing thought that conservatives thought is not openly welcome on college campuses. 

I grew up and went to college in New York State. Decades later I got my masters in Boston. I’ve only ever lived in NY, MA, and RI. Half my staff is in Seattle, and most of my travel is either to CA or (until 2020) Hong Kong. And my favorite color *is* blue. So, I’m not all that well acclimated to truly diverse political thought outside of the internet. And we know what that’s like.

So, with that long preamble aside:

1. Do colleges not welcome conservative opinions or is it a dearth of students who share the principles that presents as oppression of diverse opinion?

2. What *is* conservative opinion in an academic setting? I know what career politicians say, but they’re already of the system. In the open-minded security of a college campus, what is actual conservative opinion and what doesn’t jive with liberals?

3. What ideal would exist to allow conservative and liberal debate on campuses?

I can guess and have DuckDuckGo’d and Google Scholar’d articles. But they’re either sanitized or too biased by decades in political careers.

And I’m asking honestly here. I genuinely wish our system rewarded the kind of political and governing compromises it was designed to. This “now all right leaning policies” / “now all left leaning policies” see saw we play every 4-8 years is giving us whiplash. And the next generation is being trained in colleges now, as soon one or both of my kids may be.",askaconservative,1599782455

57,Should I make an eLearning website tailored to conservative students?,"Hey fellow conservatives,

I'm the sole founder and engineer of an existing online K-5 math education website. I made the site to help cultivate a love of math for all children. 

But these days I - like a lot of you I'm sure - see how radically liberal the education (and Big Tech firms) in our country are becoming, and how many bad values are being promoted. I worry our children will be affected by this and grow up without many conservative values.

So I'm considering making a new K-5 math website, except this one would be tailored to conservative parents who want to instill conservative values in their child. It'd still primarily teach the child math and provide math resources, but in addition it'd promote conservative values such as: pride in our country, family, opportunity, compassion, and showing how math is the language of God. 

For example, the interface could have American flags in the background, and encouragements such as ""Great job completing addition! In America you'll have the opportunity to use addition in so many ways."" (maybe that's a little cheesy, but you get what I'm saying). Just small positive conservative pro-America messages like that I think go a long way for a child in elementary school, just like they did with me when I was a kid in Sunday School. 

Perhaps I could also use the site as a way to get a Conservative Parents in Education group going, where we as a community discuss how to best navigate the world of education.

As of 2016, the average cost of childcare for one infant was [over $16,000 per year](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/THP_The51__Cascio_0419.pdf), more than $1,300 per month. For many, this cost is a massive burden, but the loss of a significant portion of household income would be a greater one. They wind up stuck between a rock and a hard place. That is a relatively new problem, as childcare costs have risen about [*2,000%*](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/89d0/1df48596e4d3e43f4dbaf05a138cafb90dfe.pdf) in the last 40 years, far outpacing inflation pr the rise of average income.

86,What would make you turn your back on Trump?,"For those of you who have \*not\* yet turned away from Trump, can you give a few scenarios or lines that you have in the sand that *were he to cross* you would no longer stand behind him?

To never turn your back on a leader no matter his choices makes you a docile servant. Personally, I will turn on my back on my leadership on many criteria, and I believe both parties have shown they don't have anything but their own incomes in mind. That's just me, though. I believe Bernie has the honest to goodness best interests for us, the people, at his heart. And I *think* most of you would agree with that? Where you would disagree is that you think his ideas just straight won't work out for the best, is how I *hope* it is.

But yes, as someone who has seen Trump stomp on... everything I honestly thought conservatives cared about, I really ask in honesty, are you a servant or can he poison the environment *too much?* Can he cut us off from foreign politics *too much?* Is there a number of *true* corona deaths you consider too high? If he made good on what he said about strengthening gun laws, would you turn?

If you got it, would you turn? If it did permanent damage to you as SARS is known to do, and covid-19 has early suggestion of doing? If he said he wasn't religious, or said he cheated on his wife, or was friends with Epstein/visited his island/took part somehow? If he bailed out undeserving companies who didn't save for a rainy day *too much* instead of undeserving individuals who didn't save for a rainy day?

I know the instinctual answer is ""I'll know it when I see it and if he does go too far I'll know"" but that's the point, *I already know what's too far and I worry that those who don't have lines in the sand will let them wash away and keep redrawing.* I get that the media offers huge biases on both sides and texture their interpretations onto events, but *those events are often still real.* Who *would* you trust to deliver the news that Trump committed a crime that Trump denies? Would you only trust Trump himself saying he did it *and* that he believes he committed a crime?

1,Should gun ownership be different in an urban environment vs. a rural environment?,"I'm thinking more in terms of how guns are stored.  My mother bought a gun when she was getting divorced from my father, but since she had the kids in the house she kept the gun in a vault in the bank.  It was more of an implied threat to Dad than anything, I guess.  But I thought that given what a gun is, it makes sense to keep it in a safe, or in a vault in a bank, especially in a more urban environment, which is where we were.  She could not have fired the gun near our house without risk of hitting somebody else in the neighborhood.

Conversely, I dated a guy in college who kept his gun on the floor in his bedroom as an implied threat to his Mom, and I thought that was a bad thing to do but I had a hard time making my case to him.  I wanted him to keep it in a safe, or at least a drawer, but he kept it on the floor by his bed, so that sometimes he or I stepped on it.  There were no little kids in his parents house, but...the look of it was bad.  If police had raided his house and seen the gun on the floor, I think they would have shot him.

* Regardless of what you think about President Trump's taxes, would you support a law mandating that future presidential candidates disclose their tax returns?
* Should Congressional subpoena power be strengthened? Weakened? On what basis should the president be permitted to withhold information requested by Congress? 
* At present, most federal ethics law do not apply to the president (though they apply to all other executive branch employees).  Should this be changed?
* What should the standards be for criminal investigations of the president? Of a presidential campaign? Should there be special limits on such investigations?

I cannot vote for a candidate who is in favor of continuing these bans, nor one who is apathetic and doesn't see any urgent need to lift them.

To my thinking, Trump instituted the EU travel ban, and could have lifted it at any time during the past several months but didn't. So I do not have much hope that he would be in a hurry to lift them if reelected. Change my mind?

But what I don't understand, and can't wrap my head around is why Donald Trump continues to enrapture a sizable population to support him. His approval ratings remain steady despite anything he's done.

I understand there is a media at large currently misrepresenting positions, and also giving us half truths, but the stuff I do know to be true (that I've actually researched and looked into personally) worries the hell out of me. From my position I see a continued assault on precedent that prior presidents set for us to follow most of which I have a hard time jiving with being Center/Left on the spectrum. An overuse of predatory language towards journalists, liberals, even conservatives who simply don't have same opinion as him or dared break rank. I see the coveted position of the US presidency being used for personal squabbles and platitudes and a man who will use executive order on a whim because of an influence in a day.

Even from moral character nothing Trump has done from 2016 till now is something a traditionalist conservative would even dream enacting and actions that are completely at odds with what my conservative grandparents would of ever dare do ever. 

To me it seems like an affront to American conservatism, the slow perversion of something that sort of reminds me of how old timer country music became the soulless stadium drivel that drives sales today. 

Donald Trump is a former Democrat from New York who has spent most his time pushing for international business and doing little to nothing for small town hidden America. He is everything that has been driving business out of this country and slowly weakening it.

C - There was little to no criminality but many miscarriages of justice.

However the video made no mention of the number of people in each bracket, the total wealth that they each group had in proportion to the other brackets and how the tax worked. Now I am a moderate, and I still feel that Govt needs to obtain taxes somehow, so how would a conservative fund policies.

13,Should the United States allow the west coast states to secede?,"Conservative here.  I didn't know if I needed to specify that upfront, but I thought it would be helpful if I did - just in case.  This thread is meant to be more of a thought-experiment and alternate-universe exercise.  Also, I'm looking for experts on this subject to help educate the rest of us on the process, practicality, and realism of this subject.

There is a lot of talk about another Civil War happening in the US.  It's an interesting topic to think about, in a fictional futuristic dystopian way.  But, realistically, the most practical results (in my opinion) of the worst-case scenario is closer to the one where after Trump wins this coming election, the west coast states will try to secede from the Union.

I'm not saying that another US Civil War won't happen, or that the US will always retain its current shape.  But this is a topic that fiction writers have covered many times.  For example, Ray Bradbury mentioned it in ""The Martian Chronicles"".  It is also the setting of the current comic book ""Undiscovered Country"", and many futuristic dystopian RPGs have this as their setting.  Shadowrun takes place primarily in the northwest US - specifically in ""The Sprawl"", which is a wasteland that coincidentally stretches from Seattle to Portland.  Autoduel takes place across a North America that has since divided up into individual territories.  And, Cyberpunk predicted the emergence of identity-politics some thirty years ago, and detailed the damage that it would do.

Whether he actually believed it or not, Lincoln stated that he did not think that US states had the right to secede from the Union.  Some historians believe this was a way for Lincoln to signal to the rest of the world that democracy will survive a massive internal war, to justify the cause of the US Civil War, to prove that democracy was not just a novel experiment, and that it was even an exercise in freedom that democracy allowed.  This thought overrode states' rights (like the southern states' ""rights"" to own slaves - ugh).  So, states' rights is a contentious subject.

Alaska and Hawaii both became US states in the 1960s.  But, US Samoa refuses to become a US state because it would then subject them to US law.  US Samoa points to Hawaii as a cautionary tale.  I don't know anything about Puerto Rico.

Sam Houston was a huge proponent of getting the Republic of Texas to join the US Union as a state,  and even though Texas has always been a bit rebellious against the rest of the Union, he is still lauded to this day as a hero and savior of the Republic of Texas because of his actions.

But, a state has never left the US Union.  I don't see why one would not be able to.  It would be much harder for a land-locked state, like Oklahoma, to secede, yes, but if the west coast wanted to secede, one point of view is, ""Why not?  Who are we to keep states captive in the Union?""

So, what does the process look like for a state to secede?  Currency?  Demographics and population?  Passports?  Borders?  Imports and exports?

And, what is the honest likelihood of that happening in the next generation or so?",askaconservative,1599148451

50,"How do you see the state of the country, and how does that affect your vote in November?","I'm an independent; on the political spectrum, I'm squarely lib-center. I haven't watched CNN or Fox in years, and I try to gather my news from a wide variety of (hopefully primary) sources, including a lot of watching the president speak.   


In my view it's clear that the country is in the worst state it's been in during my lifetime. There have always been looming problems and tensions in this country, but I have never seen those problems explode as much as they have in the last few years. We have seen the country face a variety of threats, both external (coronavirus) and internal (the brewing race war, debt, dysfunctional federal government), and in my eyes, not a single one of them seems to have gotten any better or a solution any nearer.

More specifically:  


coronavirus: think what you will about it, we have been put to shame by Europe and Aisa in how we have controlled the spread of this disease. In my eyes, the general consensus is that we are just going to accept our fate and wait for the disease to burn out. I think the fact that you still can't get a test done and have the results in any kind of meaningful time is just ridiculous 6 months into this  


I think the race problems, debt and dysfunctional fed government speaks for itself, it's hard to say anything positive on any of those fronts  


Now for my questions:  
1) do you guys see the same thing I do regarding the state of the country? maybe not on the specifics, but do you agree it's worse than you've seen it and no signs/plans of it getting better?  
2) I know this is where I'm going to lose a lot of you, but do you ever just look at the highest level and think ""this country has gotten worse and worse since we put this guy in charge, maybe it's time for a change based on that alone""?  


You can probably gather that I'm am confident in Mr. Trump's position at the helm of our county. I don't think he is all bad, there are some policy bright spots, but as far as I'm concerned his inability to respond effectivly to any of this chaos concerns me to my core. There are many things out of his control, but he is the leader of the government, and if the government is totally ineffective, then it's on him  


note: I don't like the Democrats  either and I think they have totally lost the thread on many issues facing our country. At this point I think we are well beyond policy differences and facing an existential crisis aboard a rudderless ship, so unless someone can change my mind, my vote is going to Joe Biden who, at the very least, has a track record of overseeing a country that hasn't delved into chaos. Maybe he is a 3/10 candidate in my eyes, but I see our current leadership as a 1/10",askaconservative,1598983660

A will the pendulum swing back in that direction?

Tbh I remember when Obama was elected back 2008.  I was still a kid at the time and my dad was worried like crazy, saying he was the most left wing president we had ever gotten at that point.  

Now I’m kinda looking back on his eight years and comparing it to what Bernie wants and what Biden has came into supporting and thinking, eh  Obama wasn’t that bad.  I mean we were one of the wealthiest countries in the world with the most individual opportunity in 2008 and we still had that status in 2016.  Was the recovery from the ‘08 recession underwhelming? Yes.  And was Obamacare bad?  Yes.  But it looks pretty darn moderate compared to the Green New Deal.  Obama’s policy definitely wasn’t great, but it didn’t absolutely obliterate the US economy either.  It wasn’t outright socialism.

And of course Bill Clinton is the poster child for having centrist/moderate policy.  Not much to say there.

I mean if Republicans and Democrats split the next six or so elections evenly and the Democratic Party isn’t outright socialist (unlike Obama and Bill Clinton), I think we’d be fine.  However I can’t say the same with people like Biden, Kamala Harris, Bernie, AOC etc... running that party.

So just how’d the Democratic Party get from Obama to Green New Deal?  And can we expect the Democratic Party to swing back to being moderate/sane over the next five to ten years (since let’s face it, the Republican Party can’t win a dozen consecutive elections)?",askaconservative,1598800851

For PTSD particularly, as early as the 1950s MDMA was being used successfully with therapy to help treat symptoms in WWII veterans. It actually became quite common at one point, with therapists specializing in ""shell shock"" referring to it as a ""miracle"".

LSD and psilocybin were used for therapy well before Leary made them socially and politically outcast, leading to their criminalization in the 60s. People who worked for the CIA who were part of MK Ultra were well documented as experimenting on themselves, taking LSD recreationally, and touting it's positive effects. 

For all of these substances more research needs to be done since early research was kneecapped, but every one of them show great promise in therapeutic potential. 

Meanwhile, states like CO and most likely soon to be OR and WA have legalized the recreational use of mushrooms, and just like with the legalization of cannabis have shown zero uptick in crime, death, or mental illness related to psilocybin use thus far.

Especially considering the most promising use of these substances could possibly offer relief to our over medicated and still struggling veterans, I'm curious what conservatives think about these newest developments (psilocybin legalized in soon to be 3 states, and the FDA giving the go ahead for trials for clinical use of all 3).",askaconservative,1598724103

**On infrastructure,** I believe that investment in infrastructure is important, including roads, highways, bridges, and public transportation. I do fully support public transit, and getting around should be affordable. I am tired of seeing lobbyists go in and quash public transit projects, like Koch brothers recent affair in Nashville, and what they have attempted to do in Phoenix but thankfully failed. On that note....

**On lobbying,** I think that lobbying should be illegal. Out of state donors should be illegal. Out of state campaigning should be illegal, because what right do you have telling another state how to live their lives? They live there and have to deal with the consequences, you don't. I am anti-Koch. 

**On Law and Order,** I believe in law and order, and justice. Equal justice. Break the law, get the consequences. I don't however believe in minimum sentencing, and the war on drugs is a failure, and needs to be reconsidered. I think that drug-use crimes should all be expunged, unless you're a dealer. The users need help not jail.  

**On the environment,** I believe global warming is real, and we need to be doing a lot more to protect the environment. Corporations who pollute need to be fined, or punished in some other way. I don't understand the whole anti-electric car thing coming from the GOP, and pushing for outdated things like **coal.**

**On abortion,** I believe it should be illegal unless its rape, or endangering the life of the mother. It should not be flat out illegal, but it should not be flat out legal either. If you choose to have a one night stand, you get the consequences of it. However, if you were raped, abortion should be offered as an option for you.

**On conspiracy theories,** yes people have the freedom of speech, but these shouldn't be your platform and no party should be pandering to them. unfortunately I see a lot of QAnon stuff etc being promoted by the government themselves! Whats going on here?",askaconservative,1598661635

43,Telling it like it is,"Whenever I’ve asked someone what made them vote for trump, they will usually say at some point that he just “tells it like it is”.

He kind of famously spins stories to fit his truth construct, and regularly ignores and omits facts that would make him have to answer complex or damning questions. Every scandal bounces off of him because he just doesn’t answer questions that put him in a tough spot. Or changes the subject. How is that being a straight shooter?

Also is “telling it like it is” just code for giving a voice to stereotypes and generalizations that everyone thinks are true, but too afraid to say it? I think the pc police society has gone way too far on a lot of stuff, but there is a reason stereotypes are bad. (As an example) Saying “a black guy is more likely to rob you than an Asian guy” because black men are incarcerated at a higher rate might be factually accurate in one sense, but if you take the time to understand the facts behind it, there are very complicated issues that make the original statement very unfair and inaccurate. And the damage has already been done because the statement was made and most people hearing the statement won’t take the time to research the issue and just accept it as fact.

80,Attempt 2 - Who acted in self-defense?,"In my original post I used a hypothetical situation that many people saw as me being disingenuous or trying to justify a narrative or was somehow a trap in relation to recent events. This absolutely was not the case. It was just poor timing (I had no idea about the Kenosha incident at the time) and poor wording on my part.

So here’s attempt two! No hypotheticals.

*Was Ahmaud Arbery acting in self-defense when he attacked and attempted to take Travis McMichaels gun?*

BIG NOTE - I am not asking about this in a legal sense. This isn’t about whether Travis lost the right to legal self-defense. This is purely a dictionary definition question. I personally believe that if an unknown individual aggressively attempts to take a gun from you, it makes sense to shoot them, as you cannot safely trust their intentions. My question is if you believe Ahmaud Arbery acted in self-defense?

The reason I originally asked this hypothetically is because not only did I want to remove race, I personally believe this question has nothing to do with what Ahmaud was doing or what Travis’ intentions were. Travis could have always been intending to kill Ahmuad and I’d still think the specific altercation that happened was dictionary self-defense. Both parties can act in the definition of self-defense regardless of their intentions.

This has nothing to do with race, politics, lack of police enforcement or anything like that. Please do not respond with a sermon about the current state of the US. I am not making a statement about anything. I tried asking hypothetically but it seems most people need a specific example.

87,Question from a moderate independent,"First off let me say that I legitimately believe Kyle Rittenhouse very well may have been acting entirely in self-defense. Let me also say that I’m by no means a Trump supporter.

Here’s my question though: why is it that so little blame is being put on “bad parenting” I’m this instance? I think it’s a terrible idea to let a 17 year old kid cross state lines with an assault rifle and join a militia. And while I so often see “bad parenting” and “single mother household” arguments being brought up when a black teen is carrying drugs, I haven’t seen the “bad parenting” argument be applied once in this situation. Probably not. And yet this is one clear instance in which we can say “What the hell were his parents thinking?” Would your parents have given you an assault rifle and shipped you off to a militia when you were 17? And even if they didn’t know about what he was doing, was it not neglectful if they allowed their kid to run off with an assault rifle and join a vigilante group right under their nose?

Anyways, from point of view across the political aisle, it’s annoying to see liberals frame this kid as a murderer already when we don’t know the details, and what we do know suggests he was facing a physical threat. But at the same time I’m outraged that the country is at a point where a child with an assault rifle is joining vigilante militias.",askaconservative,1598539935

Regardless of whether Trump wins or loses this election, it's clear that the current GOP has put all its eggs in the White blue collar voter basket that (obviously) worked last time.

However, IMO, this is short-term strategy. Current demographic trends show the White population shrinking and other ethnicities growing. While there are those people of color who did vote for Trump in 2016, most people of color are completely turned off by the Republican ""brand"". This is already evident in places like Texas, Georgia, and Arizona where the Hispanic and Black population is growing and is making these states increasingly competitive.

Younger voting blocs like Millenials and Gen Z already outnumber the next largest group of voters (Baby Boomers) and lean more liberal. Though they don't turn out to vote at the same rate as older generations, history says they will in the future.

I’m not sure if that was the best idea or not, but I’ve learned a lot regardless. 

I’ve been paying a lot of attention to the rhetoric coming from Trump et al. in recent weeks and I’ve honestly been pretty gobsmacked at what I’ve been hearing. The Democrats want to destroy America. The Democrats want to take your freedoms. The Democrats want to abolish the suburbs. The Democrats want to abolish the police. The list goes on. 

I understand that leading up to an election, you want to paint your opponent as having opposing values or goals, but it seems the Trump team’s strategy is scorched earth; painting the opposition as evil and cruel. On the ground and in my community, that’s not what I’m seeing or hearing from Democrats. Most are more concerned with getting Trump out of office and putting an end to the divisiveness and bickering.

If Trump is able to define Biden to voters, he will start to close the gap with Biden and I really think the debates will be fun because Trump is a savage debater.

 I think he might be able to get under Biden's skin because Biden has a meltdown whenever he argues with someone in person, remember the auto worker who confronted him earlier this year? He told him he was full of s--t  to his face and told another citizen when told that he would work for him if elected that ""no i dont work for you, maybe you should vote for someone else"".

And besides the race part, shouldn’t we disregard race for that matter but look at police brutality as a whole and to hold police officers to be held more accountable.

44,Christianity's role in modern-day conservatism: what to read?,"I am turning to this subreddit for a book recommendation as I try to get deeper into this topic. 

I'm an atheist, but a rather dispassionate and ""non-practicing"" atheist (opposite to the likes of, say, Richard Dawkins). I see value in the Christian doctrine in the sense that I recognize its role in establishing social order and in maintaining unity, allowing later the emergence of civic order and man-made laws. I consider myself a liberal conservative. I believe God has a role in society, but only if it comes in second place, since making citizenship dependant on religion is bound to generate conflicts and instability. (this all might sound familiar if you've read Roger Scruton)

Still, being a non-believer I admit it's still hard for me to see God's place in the modern world, despite recognizing the values and benefits that He has brought to it. I am trying to avoid seeing it only as a ""useful"" thing, though it has proven to be useful too for the very reasons I mentioned in the last paragraph. The point is, it evolves to be something useful precisely because its usefulness is *not* the main interest of those who seek that kind of spiritual life. It is seen as a value in its own, as something that fulfils life. 

I guess the main problem for me is to see how important God is for the shaping of conservatist thought, but not being able to believe in it due to a lack of faith. I can reconcile it for myself, though it took me a long time to get to that point too. As a general philosophy, I find it problematic to have this ""voidness of value"", seeing Christianity only as a ghost from the past. Future generations will need something to attach to (something that provides a ""value system"") and the most simple and primary form of attachment is through religion. Again, whenever I get into this line of reasoning, I tend to start seeing the *utility* of religion, which is not the point and how it is supposed to be.

Are there any authors that deal with this question?  (I hope I have made my point clear, it's not an easy topic to discuss)",askaconservative,1598338334

64,Why are many conservatives against unions?,"To preface, I am Socialist, Marxist even, so there may not be an agreement of certain key values such as individualism, the right to own property, or Anti-Statism. However, even under those pretenses, I cannot understand from any perspective why someone would be against unions.

Commonly, I see public sector unions cited as an argument against unions as a whole. First, I do not support government in unions. That is sensible, even from a Marxist perspective, the government has skewed interests that are centered away from the people as a whole. Why on Earth would I want the government to even touch unions outside of maintaining the right to do so (which I don't believe the government would)? That doesn't mean that I believe every union will end up the way I see them now; teacher unions should be founded and ran by teachers, especially on a more local level. Is there any problem with that?

Secondly, I always hear of the corruption of unions and how the unions eventually finance their way into government, or take advantage of funds greedily. I believe this is where ""Vote with your dollars"" truly applies economically; a union is funded by workers especially if it gets large enough. If a union were to corrupt, wouldn't another union simply come up as a union requires less if not no initial funding compared to a small business? Couldn't that new union also market transparency in distribution of funds? It isn't hard to keep track of donations through third parties and to track membership to ensure no dollar is misplaced. Also, even if there is a chance of corruption, wouldn't this corruption offset the possible corruption from relying on the Federal government directly? Especially if the unions were to establish a constitution that would enable workers to vote out anyone who is handling funds disagreeably? The difference between constitutions and structures between one union and another  can be as or even more difference of one country's constitution and another.  can In addition to this, even if a union were to lobby government officials, wouldn't this increase our advantage against corporate lobbyists? It also isn't necessarily a given that a union would lobby AGAINST worker interests, but if it did, it would go back to the point I was making earlier in regards to going to another union. I am not arguing for or against lobbying; I am saying that if lobbying is a given, wouldn't union lobbying help against corporate lobbying?

Third, I see unions as preferable to a minimum wage. Unions are variably decentralized; there can be unions for a certain job position, separate work places,  separate industries which can be geographically separated by city and state, etc. I hear Scandinavian nations are reducing their taxes and don't have a minimum wage. However, these countries are also union heavy which may serve as to WHY they don't need a minimum wage. Unions enable negotiating power between workers and business owner which can cause wages to increase and have it be specified towards particular areas of the business without government involvement.  I would prefer ""Free Market + Unions"" over ""Keynesian+ No Unions""; in fact, when democrats complain about needing to increase the minimum wage, why not just tell them ""Just unionize""? It is more market friendly and dynamic by nature in comparison to the minimum wage. As such, it wouldn't have the same damage to the middle class and above as a minimum wage would. Less government taxes, less minimum wage, and less government touching stuff. Hell, I believe Unions are the best path towards a free market.

Fourth, it inspires education of economy and finance. When negotiating wages, businesses would be more likely to explain and justify their finances in order to lower any potentially unreasonable and mutually destructive demands made by workers. This would increase worker understanding of business finance and would encourage more people coming from less advantaged backgrounds without having to spend 20,000 dollars to learn from a professor without any direct experience in business. It would increase the amount of small businesses by the mere education potential alone, along with the increase in average wages. It would increase understanding of how government policy can hurt businesses AND workers, and we would have more people making political stances based off of actual understanding of economics.

Fifth, assuming it does raise wages dynamically, wouldn't this increase standard of living, thus lowering the liberal demand for subsidized contraceptives, subsidized Healthcare, abortions, Food stamps, etc. and thus further lower government involvement?

I think everyone should have the right to own guns, even automatic rifles, but I think we need more background checks and generally make it more difficult to acquire to weed out psychos. Being from Texas, I know a lot of gun enthusiasts and my family owns guns as well.

The hot topic at the moment is police reform. Some saying we should completely abolish the police, others we saying we should reduce funding, and some people who are more conservative saying we should further increase funding. When talk of gun control comes about, one argument I hear conservatives make is that guns are essential to fight against a government if it becomes tyrannical. To my understanding, this notion comes from the era of the founding fathers, when organized militias were extremely effective. I know that's not the only argument for why we need guns, but I don't understand why someone would be against a tyrannical government, and at the same time be in favor of beefing up the police and further being ""out gunned"". Conservatives seem to also love low taxes, but a large chunk of that money goes into our military, an institution that has had the capability of wiping out any civil rebellion as example by the crazy amount of drone strikes we deploy in foreign countries.

* America’s justice system is deeply corrupt and will not prosecute even clearly guilty people like Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama.

* America’s justice system is deeply corrupt and will not prosecute even clearly guilty people like Donald Trump. The Supreme Court was also stolen and will thwart the will of the people by overriding the other two branches of government.

Parties lay out their policies. The relevant government departments run the election. Someone wins. Someone loses. Power flips back and forth. Nobody claims the results are illegitimate.

Nobody knows the names of our Supreme Court justices and nobody remembers which party nominated them. There are no “blocks” who vote together. They just vote their conscience every time.

As far as I know I could be describing the UK, Canada, Australia, India, New Zealand, Germany, any Northern European country...if I’m wrong I’d like to hear it. I would expect to hear the stuff above about Congo or Venezuela or Belarus, not an anglosphere developed nation.

I have the following questions for both sides in America:

1. Do you acknowledge that Americans see American democracy and their ideological opponents in a much harsher light than every other G7 country?

2. Do Americans see it that way because America’s democratic systems really are more corrupt and untrustworthy than other G7 countries? And the opposition party (to your side) really is worse?

3. If America is really more corrupt, and the opposition really worse, can the process be reversed?

4. Are you contributing materially to any plan or project which would reverse the corruption and convince the opposition to stop undermining America?

5. Does your plan or project for saving America depend upon your party seizing power and enacting its programs over the wishes of the other party or do you have a plan or project that would appeal to tens millions of people of good will “on the other side?”",askaconservative,1598179584

It’s like why Advil costs $300 when in care but $10-$20 at Walmart. What’s inflating these costs? Why don’t Republicans fix it? I’ve personally seen this and it’s absurd.

I’ve looked into it on Google and I see a lot of talk about how administration costs eat up a lot of the funding for welfare programs which I can understand but my biggest “hurdle” that stands in the way of me believing this point is that charitable giving often falls when it is needed the most. 

In the Great Recession, charitable donations fell by 50 billion and didn’t even recover half of that loss until 2012 or so iirc. I still don’t think it’s recovered to the same levels when adjusting for inflation, right? In contrast, government programs can always expand.

* **John Kasich**: The former Ohio governor and 2016 presidential candidate is not only endorsing Biden, but also speaking at the DNC to support the former vice president.

**Undecided publicly but skeptical,** [via a New York Times report](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/06/us/politics/trump-biden-republicans-voters.html):

* **George W. Bush:** The former president has reportedly decided not to support Trump's re-election, though he's made no public statements to that end.
* **Jeb Bush:** The former Florida governor and 2016 presidential candidate is so far reportedly undecided.
* **Cindy McCain:** The widow of the late Sen. John McCain (Ariz.) will reportedly vote for Biden, but remains unsure how public to be about it.

**Worth noting:** While former top military leaders like Mattis and John Kelly are technically non-partisan, they both served in Trump's administration and have publicly expressed skepticism about the president's standing ahead of the 2020 election.

32,Disapproval of the gays,"To begin, my apologies if this has been asked before. I am new to this sub. Feel free to link me to a previous post if it’s appropriate to answer my question. 

This one is for the conservatives who don’t strictly align with religion, specifically Christianity. 

Why do you not approve of gay/lesbian/other LGBT people/ relationships? Why do you think they don’t deserve marriage rights? Even if you do think it’s their right to marry but still harbor some negative opinions towards them, what does it stem from?  
I don’t agree personally with the religious viewpoint of homosexuality, but those who believe in this still have some sort of reasoning for these beliefs, therefore this question doesn’t apply directly to them. 
 My confusion lies in those who don’t support the LGBT+ community in its entirety for reasons that are not religious. What are those reasons? 
Or, for conservatives who do support the LGBT community but associate with or talk to people who do not, what are their reasons? Do you, as a conservative supporter, think their beliefs are reasonable? 
 
I sometimes hear or read some people say “I don’t hate gay people but I don’t approve of their lifestyle.”  I sense a level of narcissism in this mindset. Considering something “gross” or “wrong” just because it’s different than your own personal life presents nothing other than close mindedness and self absorption. 

Also, if you ARE religious, after many cases of proven mistranslations of the Bible proving that God doesn’t disapprove of homosexuality, why do you choose to not alter your beliefs?

I sincerely hope that this isn't taken as some kind of virtue signalling or propaganda piece, I am not paid or influenced by someone else nor would I ever want to be when handling such delicate topics.","I believe I hold beliefs that are part of both liberal and conservative although to a lesser extent

I hold beliefs that are generally considered conservative such as self sustainability, self responsibility and discipline, and overall strong societal stability and morality.  In my mind there is no questioning these as they are objectively correct, there's no arguing is a person should be self-sustainable as it's a pretty ideal way to live.  No human being should want society to unravel or depend too much on organizations and companies that they can't trust.  The topic of government is no different, I believe a government shouldn't be limited. Such a giant society with so many different beliefs and personalities needs structure that people can depend on.  After all, a passenger shouldn't want everyone on the plane to start causing a ruckus the crew can't keep from harming or harassing others.

However I also hold generally liberal views.  I consider myself compassionate and support other's personal freedom as long as it is moral, hurts nobody and does little if at all to interfere with their lives and the lives of others.  I consider Homosexuality moot, any person that can find a consenting partner willing to share a mutually affectionate relationship is no **less** or no **more** a person than a conventional heterosexual couple.  Same with Transgenderism, *provided the feelings that they are the opposite gender are genuine (not fabricated for attention, even it is difficult to determine) and will truly make them content and free to continue contributing to society positively*.  Not everybody should be forced to believe these, but the right to choose to be better for oneself regardless of what others think is an admirable trait of human society.  It only holds us back to get caught on such negligible issues just for the sake of saying it opposes a strict traditional viewpoint.

However, there are aspects I disagree with and dislike from both sides.  Christianity itself shouldn't be a predominant force for every person, it is a person's choice to follow a religion be they born into believing or have enough introspection to wonder if it is what is best for them to believe in a higher power to replace mindless consumerism or whatnot.  However it should NOT be mandatory to agree with/include every other religion.  On the other hand, Liberalism as of the last few years seems to have been fronted by people who take the idea of personal freedom too far, and scream fascism at anyone who shows even slight hesitance at being forced to include specific groups and the like (it even seems that forming and using a victim complex to end discussion isn't very well regulated or frowned upon.)

66,Here is my take on how Trump voters see things. What am I getting right and what am I missing?,"I have been asking and listening for the past few years and this is the impression I have of the average Trump voter position. 

**To be clear, I do not hold these beliefs.** I just want to know if My general understanding is correct. Obviously, individual results may vary. 

1. White Trump supporters feel like liberals want them to feel guilty or ashamed for their identity. Being white or Christian or straight or in some cases successful. Or for things like not being comfortable with complicated gender identities. In the process they feel like they are being told that they have to change behavior, the words they use and more. If they don’t do it, they get labeled. 

2. I get the impression that Trump supporters think previous leaders have paid too much deference to NATO, The EU, China, etc. They view Trump’s position as an end to the idea of ""speak softly but carry a big stick"" approach. I think they also see this as a reason for the rise of China and the outflow of US manufacturing. 

3. Trump voters seem to share the traditional conservative idea that government programs are handouts. 

4. Trump voters like that Trump does not apologize. He does not back down. He does not allow people to criticize him without hitting back. I get the impression that they like these qualities because it’s something they wish they could do in their own lives. Some probably do, some probably don’t but it feels like an emotional kinship more than anything else. 

5. Tired of being pushed around: Building on these ideas they have a sense that they themselves have been pushed around over the last 20 odd years and Trump is saying that “America won’t stand for it anymore. We’re the richest, we have the biggest military. We don’t have to worry about what Europe or NATO or China wants.” This seems like what people are responding to when Trump talks America First.

6. Trump has delivered on guns rights, tax cuts, judicial appointments in both federal districts and Supreme Court. He has also delivered on a hardline approach to immigration. They know he can’t just make a wall happen on his own, but the fact that he is always tough on the issue is good enough to make progress over time.",askaconservative,1597864822

He's got the school shooter look and frankly, if you don't want to be treated with suspicion, you shouldn't dress or get a haircut like a school shooter. I'm not saying it justifies what happened to him, but it's something to consider. Kids need to learn that if you want to be treated with respect, get a job and ditch the school shooter haircut.

Yet how could they be so ungrateful, after all they belonged to one of the most democratic countries in the world at the time.

I will freely admit that I am going to take a critical view and that definitely does alter how I interpret things but like I genuinely make quite an effort to try and see if I am being unfair in my way of seeing things and while I can understand the part where any of these things on their own is pretty minor, when viewed as a whole I just can't find any way to see it other than Trump doesn't really care much about what he is allowed to do, only what he wants to do.

93,What is the conservative position on racial disparities?,"I'm sure this question has been asked quite often (especially recently), so if there is another good thread that you think will answer my question, please feel free to redirect. The question refers primarily to the large gap in median household wealth by black versus white heads of household. According to the sources I've seen, black median household wealth is around $17,000 and white median household wealth is around $170,000.

I am seeking explanations from both sides of the aisle. I suppose the first question would be to confirm whether the numbers are accurate. Perhaps some will take issue with that. But if we can establish that there is a significant disparity here on the basis of race (on the order of 10-1), we must now start searching for explanations.

For people that aren't in the top 10% or so (which would be a net worth of around $2 million), most of their wealth is in their homes. So when we look at this disparity at the median level, it would most likely reflect a large disparity in homeownership. And we see this as well, with white homeownership rates at 72% and black rates at 42%.

It seems to me many on the left are making the argument that we must look to redlining to explain this gap. From what I've heard on the right, the counter is that redlining has been extinct for 50 years and that the wealth gap must be explained by other factors. I've heard a bit of discussion regarding the impact of welfare and other safety net programs such as public housing acting as disincentives wealth accumulation in black communities, but I haven't really heard the argument articulated clearly. 

Was hoping we could continue this discussion further. I merely seek to learn something new here. Thank you",askaconservative,1597762109

Because right now everyone else’s hospital bills go up to pay for these people who won’t or can’t pay since medical debt is the debt that has the least amount of power. I myself am for a hybrid system where at base everyone is covered with a private option for ppl who want to skip wait times. As well as decrease regulations on the amount of students that can be admitted to medical school and decrease medical regulations as well so there’s more competition.

Whereas just when you and other nations are beginning to be provided with letters and the other requisites of civilized life, after the usual interval, the stream from heaven, like a pestilence, comes pouring down, and leaves only those of you who are destitute of letters and education; and so you have to begin all over again like children, and know nothing of what happened in ancient times, either among us or among yourselves. As for those genealogies of yours which you just now recounted to us, Solon, they are no better than the tales of children. In the first place you remember a single deluge only, but there were many previous ones; in the next place, you do not know that there formerly dwelt in your land the fairest and noblest race of men which ever lived, and that you and your whole city are descended from a small seed or remnant of them which survived. And this was unknown to you, because, for many generations, the survivors of that destruction died, leaving no written word. For there was a time, Solon, before the great deluge of all, when the city which now is Athens was first in war and in every way the best governed of all cities, is said to have performed the noblest deeds and to have had the fairest constitution of any of which tradition tells, under the face of heaven.

Or, do you tone down your message  and try to be friendly to people you disagree with, even if that runs  the risk of not calling out bad or dangerous ideas as much (at least, as  I see it)

I managed to find a thread from over a year ago, which the conservate responders said she managed  to change their minds on issues around transgender people (becoming  pro-trans), that she didn't address conservative arguments seriously  enough and attacked strawmen... and some personal attacks on her that  I'm going to pretend don't exist.

I used to love that... until I saw people on the right trying to end people's rights based on their feelings. Before you deny that... I will explain examples.

&amp;#x200B;

I saw on this forum and some others, ""If you fly a Mexican flag, you should be deported. It's anti-American."" This is one of the most screwed up things I heard, and honestly, annoys me as much as far left politics. People have Freedom of Speech! They have every right to be proud of the countries of their ancestors or countries of their origins. If you feel that's anti-American, it's absolutely ok. But you cannot suppress those people's rights because again, their rights don't end where your feelings begin. They have freedom of speech. More importantly, there is NOTHING anti-American about flying foreign flags. Nothing. (unless America would be at war with a country, but that's completely different story). I repeat, people have a right to fly whatever flag they want. As long as they don't burn an American flag (which I do strongly oppose and do feel should actually be criminalized), there is NOTHING wrong with flying foreign flags. If you don't like it, it's absolutely okay, but those people's rights do not end where your feelings begin.

 This presidential election however is different.

The Democrats used to be a center left leaning party that had liberals, moderates and a few conservatives within it but they had a bigger tent. The party of Bill Clinton is not the party of Biden and Harris, Today the liberal wing has completely taken over the Democratic party. This started with Obama but really accelerated when Bernie Sanders became mainstream in 2016. As much as trump can sound like an idiot sometimes, the democrat's actual policy proposals are idiotic and frankly scary. 

I fully believe if Biden wins the election and Nancy pelosi stays on as speaker and Chuck Schumer becomes majority leader, we will start to see a radical change in American society.  

ICE will be abolished 

Green new deal will be passed

Every federal statue or monument with even a hint at being offensive will be removed.

Military will be defunded 

Border crossings will be legalized  or decriminalized

Guns will be severely restricted 

Military bases will be renamed

China will have more influence over the United states 

On the federal level, police will have a harder time doing their jobs because they won't have the resources they need

Democrats will pass a slavery reparations bill where the descendants of slave owners who had nothing to do with slavery itself would be forced to pay money to the descendants of slaves who were never enslaved themselves and this would come from federal tax dollars. 

DC will be made the 51st state even though this was  not the idea of the founding fathers, so they can get an extra 2 senators that would always be democratic  and an extra congressional seat.

They would politicize the supreme court by expanding it so they can get decisions favorable to them.

The head of the Iowa Postal Workers Union alleged Tuesday that mail sorting machines are ""being removed"" from Post Offices in her state due to new policies imposed by Postmaster General Louis DeJoy, a major GOP donor to President Donald Trump whose operational changes have resulted in dramatic mail slowdowns across the nation.

Asked by NPR's Noel King whether she has felt the impact of DeJoy's changes, Iowa Postal Workers Union President Kimberly Karol—a 30-year Postal Service veteran—answered in the affirmative, saying ""mail is beginning to pile up in our offices, and we're seeing equipment being removed.""

""I don't see this as cost-saving measures. I see this as a way to undermine the public confidence in the mail service.""
—Kimberly Karol, Iowa Postal Workers Union

Karol went on to specify that ""equipment that we use to process mail for delivery""—including sorting machines—is being removed from Postal Service facilities in Iowa as DeJoy rushes ahead with policies that, according to critics, are sabotaging the Postal Service's day-to-day operations less than 90 days before an election that could hinge on mail-in ballots.

They always down play Covid 19 saying it's not as bad as the flu, or the flu is still much worse so it's not a big deal at all.

I looked up the numbers for this and it's just completely not true. Flu season death rate in 2019 was 0.138%, previous years floated around the same number. Covid 19 death rate is 3.2% so far, with 4 months to go in the year. That's an insane difference, and it isn't like the Flu deaths have gone away yet.

So my question mainly is why is this the case? Why is there such a unanimous dismissal, or downplaying of corona from conservatives?

I'm looking for an anti BLM position for this, since mine dropped out last minute. I'm more than happy to work with your schedule, and I will not pass judgement against you. 

The goal for my segment is to shed light on both sides of BLM, and give each side a voice. I promise this will not be skewed, and I will not edit the video unless there are any long pauses or unnecessary events. (People talking to you in the background or whatever.) This will be on zoom, so there is no required place to be. I have a debate outline on google docs I will share with each of you so you can do your best to be prepared and there will be no surprises. (Except for the question segment.) I would prefer if youd add me on facebook so I can add you into a group chat with your opponent so we can organize in real time. We can work out the details in my DMs. 

I am a very open minded person, and I'm excited to learn from whoever is interested. Please either comment or message me if this interests you. 

Remember, this is a DEBATE. Not a preaching platform. (I said this in my post seeking a pro BLM person as well, dont worry.)",askaconservative,1596938231

Donald had nothing like that.

And yet Donald prevailed.  When I asked years ago (with a previous reddit account) ""what was wrong with Jeb?""  I got answers like ""he's a pussy"" or ""he's a dweeb"".

As the years passed, more articles came out about the phenomenon of Trump appealing to *white masculinity*.  The word ""Alpha Male"" kept getting used about him.  

It seemed like on one side their were more white collar conservatives with a *cerebral* bent who might have gone for Jeb, while blue collar conservatives were more invested *emotionally* and preferred Trump.

Excerpts:

&gt;A Black Louisiana man will spend the rest of his life in prison for stealing hedge clippers, after the Louisiana Supreme Court denied his request to have his sentence overturned last week. Fair Wayne Bryant, 62, was convicted in 1997 on one count of attempted simple burglary...

&gt;Bryant was convicted in 1979 for attempted armed robbery, in 1987 for possession of stolen things, attempted forgery of a check worth $150 in 1989 and for simple burglary of an inhabited dwelling in 1992, all before his 1997 arrest for the failed attempt at stealing the hedge clippers.

My proposal does not relate to existing provisions that federal courts allow them to decide that state courts have erred in their rulings, based on misapplication of law.

Rather, the proposal here is to limit states' *absolute rights* in criminal sentencing;  federal oversight would allow termination or modification of any state sentences deemed  *cruel punishment,* violating the 8th amendment.  

If this already exists, my bad, but if so, federal interference/involvement  of this nature is not common.  Ergo, some sort of new federal authority is needed  to empower it to overturn *some* of these excessive state penalties, which we see regularly in America, and contribute to our nation's problems of 1) mass incarceration and 2) increasing perception of that black Americans disproportionately receive unjust punishment.",askaconservative,1596852929
15,Why support the Iraq war (2003)?,"I’ve seen that many conservatives and Republicans talk about the War in Iraq as a positive thing the US did in trying to find WMDs and expelling Saddam Hussein from power.

However, there isn’t any evidence, even back in 2003, to justify an invasion. US Intelligence reports shortly after the invasion and even before reported that the government had lied about the existence of WMDs in Iraq. In addition, the US claimed that Saddam Hussein has broken a UN resolution, but was not found guilty by the UN and thus the US was not approved by the UN to invade. The US also tried to link Saddam Hussein to Al Qaeda and Osama Bin Laden, but was unsuccessfully able to provide any evidence to establish the link.

The aftermath of this invasion was even worse. Before, we had actually assisted Saddam Hussein in his invasion against Iran to overthrow the Ayatollah taking power, and by capturing him and dismantling his regime, we destabilized Iraq and lost a longtime ally. This led to the rise of ISIS and other terror groups taking place with the chaos.

My question is, knowing all of this information, why does any conservative support the War in Iraq?",askaconservative,1596843838
16,What is so bad about the Iran Nuclear Deal?,"I’ve seen Trump and many conservatives especially since 2016 who have railed on the Iran Nuclear Deal as an awful piece of diplomacy.

To me, this seems like an awful trade, as no one would ever use a nuclear weapon. By giving back Iran these assets and lifting sanctions, we’ve essentially empowered Iran for almost nothing in return.

- Combined 1.5 trillion debt
- That it is a protected debt, from bankruptcy etc unlike most others

I understand freedom of contract, but are 17/18yos capable of understanding the ramifications of the enormous loan they are taking out? As a progressive, to me this is an example of the free market leading to unenviable outcomes as a result of predatory lending and cartel pricing from the education providers.

Take it how you want to take it but Professor Allan Lichtman just gave trump the kiss of death. His election model has predicted every presidential election correctly since 1984. He even predicted that Trump would defeat Clinton in 2016 when everyone said Clinton would win. The polls show a larger lead for Biden than Hillary Clinton ever had. Currently the RCP average has a 7.4% Biden lead, he is leading in every battleground state. Some may say, oh well its just the pandemic. 

Not necessarily true, It's not impossible for presidents to get re elected in times of crisis, FDR did it a few times and Abraham Lincoln won re election when the country literally was split in half. I think his response to the pandemic never was popular among voters and this is what will cost him the election in November.

* WSJ works for me, but it's just one side conservatism.
* I wanted to like National Review, but I haven't been able to. All the articles I've read have either conflated correlation with causation, or began with an unstated philosophical belief that I didn't share (e.g. ""raising a family is morally better than discovering new things"" or ""growth is more important than inequality when evaluating a country's economy""). This is also why I haven't been able to get into conservative speakers like Ben Shapiro.
* Fox is way too sensationalist for me—I become cynical when I read it, which is the opposite of what I'm trying to accomplish.

Any suggestions of what to try? I'm open to things that do more reporting, investigative journalism,  editorials, or academic publications. For reference, my current favorite news sources are Reuters, BBC, Washington Post, Trevor Noah, and research preprint servers like [biorXiv](https://www.biorxiv.org).

It's my hope that this may be useful to other liberals looking for ways to expand their sources of information, since it sometimes feels like conservative sources are only written for people who are already conservative.

5,"Drugs, homelessness, and free will.","Throughout my younger years I have tried a myriad of different drugs (pot/psychedelics/other party substances) recreationally. As I have gotten older I have calmed down and find more enjoyment in working towards new goals and being outdoors than I do going to concerts and experimenting with drug use. I have lost a friend due to overdose and have seen the negative effects drugs can have on people’s lives, even legal vices such as cigarettes. It’s surprising to me that the only problem I really ever had was with alcohol, which is legal. I think people should be given the choice to do whatever they want with their bodies so long as it’s not directly endangering others, but that’s a slippery slope when you think about things such as homelessness and addiction. I’m conflicted between believing that people should be given the leeway to make their own choices, but I also don’t think it’s fair to expect tax payers to fund things like rehab when people’s lives are torn apart from taking that risk. I would like to hear some different views.

(TL;DR)

Would drug legalization directly impact the homeless population?

Aren’t drug users going to be using drugs whether they’re legal or not?

I understand you can control drugs from foreign countries with border control, but a lot of drugs are manufactured domestically such as meth, and controlling that issue seems near impossible. 

Should there be a “war on drugs” or should people be left to their own free will even if it’s potentially harmful since they’re going to do them illegally anyway?

Lets say someone, for whatever reason, really can't work, or just lost his job, and because he never made much in the first place, he doesn't have enough money to pay for his bills until he finds a job. So, basically, people who really have no way to put food on the table and pay their bills, for whatever reason. This includes people that for health reasons might not be able to get a job, or simply someone that's going through a really tough financial situation. 

In this context, are you in favour of a ""tough luck"" approach and just leave people on their own? If they can't eat, that's their problem. If you can't pay rent, go live on the street.

24,Questions about the conservative viewpoint on abolishing the minimum wage,"Former conservative turned ""radical leftist"" here.

I have seen many conservatives support abolishing the minimum wage, claiming that it would create so many jobs and boost economic growth. If we were to eliminate minimum wage laws, then what is stopping every company with workers making minimum wage from lowering their pay to $2 per hour or lower?  Doing so would dramatically raise corporate  profitability while also cutting labor costs. From the perspective of any company, it is a very easy, logical decision to make. They would then have even more money to funnel into stock buybacks and create more value for shareholders. Realistically that is where all of the increased corporate profits would go to. This has been proven by the airline industry, which put 96 percent of its free cash flow into share buybacks over the last ten years. 

But this fails to account for the devastating impact this would have on people at the bottom of the economic ladder. Sure, people could get jobs more easily, but making only $2 per hour how are they supposed to survive? These jobs may be low skill, but most minimum wage jobs are essential jobs that need to be performed for society to function. Grocery store workers during the pandemic are a perfect example of this. There will always need to be someone on the bottom of the economic ladder doing these jobs.  The argument I see most conservatives make is that they need to gain skills and experience that make the value of their labor worth more than the minimum wage. The value of someone's labor is always worth more than what they are paid. If it wasn't the company wouldn't hire them. So where do conservatives draw the line at how valuable someone's labor is? Is it a percentage of the profits that employee generates? Is it just the bare minimum amount that employers can get away with paying? It certainly isn't the free market, because wages have been stagnant for 40 years despite increased worker productivity and corporate profits. If the free market worked to raise wages for employees then it would have happened in 40 years.

Also, there are not enough good jobs available if everyone gained more skills and experience. This would then drive down wages for skilled labor because of the increased supply of qualified people. This is why we see so many young people today with college degrees struggling to find any entry level positions, because record numbers of people are going to college and acquiring the skills needed and increasing the skilled labor supply.

Another argument I see made is that minimum wage jobs were never meant to provide a livable wage and that mostly teenagers do those jobs. 90 percent of minimum wage workers are not teenagers, including myself. They may have never been meant for adults, but the reality is that in this economy, more and more people are desperate for any job at all. If minimum wage was eliminated, there would certainly be enough people desperate enough to eat that they would work for any amount. I don't believe that wages are a fair negotiation between employers and employees when the employee desperately needs money to eat. 

The last argument I see conservatives make that I'm going to talk about is hard work. ""People making minimum wage are lazy and don't work hard enough"" is something I have seen quite frequently. As someone who now works 2 minimum wage jobs and is a full time college student I can tell you from my experience that this is not the case. I worked for 9 and a half hours straight yesterday with only one 15 minute break, doing physically exhausting work the entire time for minimum wage. And I'm still not working hard enough? I feel very fortunate to be in california where the minimum wage is much higher than most parts of the country. In many places there are people doing the same backbreaking work for substantially less than what I earn because the minimum wage is lower. In a hypothetical world of no minimum wage this amount would go down even more.

With all that said, I would like you to convince me why wages would ever rise and everyone would benefit from abolishing the minimum wage. Right now I see it as business owners and shareholders wanting to increase their profits and nothing more. I have changed my political views before and will gladly consider points i may have missed here. I know there are some certainly but this post was already getting far too long.

The majority of the left wants a capitalist system with safety nets, much like you would find in much of Europe. These countries are still considered capitalist countries, even in northern Europe, where social programs are the strongest in the world. The social programs work. Universal Health Care works well in Western and Northern Europe, but not as well in Eastern Europe, where there is not as much money to fund it. Our free market system is wildly expensive. A simple illness or injury could cost thousands of dollars. On any given day, you could suddenly be $2,000 in debt because of a broken arm. The hospital bill could be more painful than the actual injury. Even if we count money that comes from taxation, nowhere else does it cost $2,000 for a broken arm.

I am stanchly pro-life, I believe in the right to bear arms and to form militias, I believe religion and traditions still have a place in our society, and I believe that my ideas work best within a free market capitalist system.

75,Deos Europe's success debunk social concervatism,"So the general theory of social concervatism goes that institutions like marriage, the family unit, the church, and other mediating institutions are responsible for creating the social fabric that our society is based off. They create opportunities for individuals within a community to build stronger bonds with each other and as a result are responsible for the well being of the community. Additionally they are responsible for enstiling hard work, responsibility, and traditional values in future generations. So when these institutions fall apart the social fabric that our society is based of unravels and future generations become irresponsible lazy and without traditional values. It is then postulated that several american social issues of the day can be blamed on the collapse of mediating institutions. These problems include America's drug problems, America's acedemic decline, America's mental health problems, the overall lack of industriousness and responsibility of the average american(the amount that american liter or the number of americans who refuse to where face masks come to mind), and even the obesity epedemic.

Now over the past couple of months I have become a big fan of this way of thinking however it has one problem that I relly don't know how to adress and that is that if this is true then why don't we see a similar collapse in society in european countries. In european countries church attendance is very low compared to america and atheism has been on a steady climb for a while. Aditionsly most european countries have divorce rates that are either below or roughly the same as in america.

However, true socialism is not within the mainstream of U.S. politics. Many conservatives seem to instead define socialism as any sort of welfare or social programs meant to help the poor and willingly describe many Democrats as socialist in a pejorative manner. They then appeal to emotion in saying that this definition of socialism will destroy America, even as the other side of the aisle genuinely thinks such policies are the moral and prudent thing to do to better the country.

The message was poorly argued in the movie and I think Smith's character was being emasculated to set up a message, but maybe I'm looking too much into it.

After watching that movie, I listened to a lecture from C.S. Lewis' ""Why I Am Not A Pacifist Part 1"" on YouTube (I'm going to watch/listen to Part 2 soon).

36,Would the Democratic policies cause the US middle class to cease existing similar to Venezuela or would middle class lifestyle simply become more difficult/expensive to achieve and maintain like it is in many EU countries like Germany?,"I know this may sound like a really dumb question, but hear me out.  Although I’m a conservative myself and have been for awhile, I really can’t pin down how far the left the Democrats are and how far they may go.  

And this matters a lot to me because growing up in a conservative family (I’m 23 rn btw), politics has always been a very anxiety filled topic because the way my parents and extended family talked about politics even from when I was too young to even grasp how politics actually worked, made me feel like my own future was completely dependent on which party had power and which one didn’t.  The idea that I always got in my mind was that as soon as the Democrats took power, the middle class would cease to exist; we’d have an elite ruling class and everyone else would be poor.

And the reason I use the Venezuela/EU example is that although they’re both ruled under left wing policies, they’ve undergone drastically different results, with the former having citizens starving en mass, and the latter still having a high standard of living and quality of life compared to the rest of the world despite having problems caused by said left wing policies.

And I get that there’s still a lot of nuance to this like the fact that a lot of EU social democrat policies not being as compatible with the US as they are in Europe.

Also why or why not?","Let me preface this by saying I’m conservative myself and I’m a bit annoyed with the virtue signaling in pro sports right now mostly because BLM as an organization is a self-proclaimed Marxist organization.  And I do think divisive hot button political issues should be left out of sports and entertainment.  However I’m not going crazy about it like some fellow conservatives around me because I know that: 1. These leagues likely genuinely believe that they’re fighting against police brutality against innocent black Americans (despite reality being a bit more varied and complex than that, with all the high profile cases we’ve seen) 2.  I understand that in their situation it’s both good for attaining social capital from others in the greater entertainment industry as well as on social media and probably real dollars from branding and shoe sales.  And along with that it hurts to go against the grain.  3.  There is no real alternative to pro sports.  Even college level sports just isn’t the same in terms of play especially for basketball.  If Coke was doing this sort of thing, then I might consistently switch to Pepsi.  But in my opinion there really is no comparable product to pro sports.

So I haven’t understood the difference in my attitude about it vs other conservatives around me.

The only thing I can think of is maybe it’s the fact they’ve spent more money on tickets on it than myself.  But even that doesn’t explain away the willingness to stop paying for sports channels and watching on cable.

That's not the same thing as government spending. Take the military for example. The government pays for goods and services that comprise defense architecture by purchasing these from contractors and manufacturers. The government does not confiscate these items, it buys them on the free market. 

The draft might be the best example of seizing the means of production, that being labor. When the choice to participate in the military is stripped, the draftees are no longer considered free agents and thus they have no private ownership of their own labor. This is the closest example of socialism in America that I can think of.

81,Which Healthcare system do you like to support?,"The Beveridge Model

Named after William Beveridge, the daring social reformer who designed Britain’s National Health Service. In this system, health care is provided and financed by the government through tax payments, just like the police force or the public library.
Many, but not all, hospitals and clinics are owned by the government; some doctors are government employees, but there are also private doctors who collect their fees from the government. In Britain, you never get a doctor bill. These systems tend to have low costs per capita, because the government, as the sole payer, controls what doctors can do and what they can charge.
Countries using the Beveridge plan or variations on it include its birthplace Great Britain, Spain, most of Scandinavia and New Zealand. Hong Kong still has its own Beveridge-style health care, because the populace simply refused to give it up when the Chinese took over that former British colony in 1997. Cuba represents the extreme application of the Beveridge approach; it is probably the world’s purest example of total government control.

The Bismarck Model

Named for the Prussian Chancellor Otto von Bismarck, who invented the welfare state as part of the unification of Germany in the 19th century. Despite its European heritage, this system of providing health care would look fairly familiar to Americans. It uses an insurance system — the insurers are called “sickness funds” — usually financed jointly by employers and employees through payroll deduction.
Unlike the U.S. insurance industry, though, Bismarck-type health insurance plans have to cover everybody, and they don’t make a profit. Doctors and hospitals tend to be private in Bismarck countries; Japan has more private hospitals than the U.S. Although this is a multi-payer model — Germany has about 240 different funds — tight regulation gives government much of the cost-control clout that the single-payer Beveridge Model provides.
The Bismarck model is found in Germany, of course, and France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Japan, Switzerland, and, to a degree, in Latin America.

The National Health Insurance Model

This system has elements of both Beveridge and Bismarck. It uses private-sector providers, but payment comes from a government-run insurance program that every citizen pays into. Since there’s no need for marketing, no financial motive to deny claims and no profit, these universal insurance programs tend to be cheaper and much simpler administratively than American-style for-profit insurance.
The single payer tends to have considerable market power to negotiate for lower prices; Canada’s system, for example, has negotiated such low prices from pharmaceutical companies that Americans have spurned their own drug stores to buy pills north of the border. National Health Insurance plans also control costs by limiting the medical services they will pay for, or by making patients wait to be treated.
The classic NHI system is found in Canada, but some newly industrialized countries — Taiwan and South Korea, for example — have also adopted the NHI model.

The Out-of-Pocket Model

Only the developed, industrialized countries — perhaps 40 of the world’s 200 countries — have established health care systems. Most of the nations on the planet are too poor and too disorganized to provide any kind of mass medical care. The basic rule in such countries is that the rich get medical care; the poor stay sick or die.
In rural regions of Africa, India, China and South America, hundreds of millions of people go their whole lives without ever seeing a doctor. They may have access, though, to a village healer using home-brewed remedies that may or not be effective against disease.
In the poor world, patients can sometimes scratch together enough money to pay a doctor bill; otherwise, they pay in potatoes or goat’s milk or child care or whatever else they may have to give. If they have nothing, they don’t get medical care.
These four models should be fairly easy for Americans to understand because we have elements of all of them in our fragmented national health care apparatus. When it comes to treating veterans, we’re Britain or Cuba. For Americans over the age of 65 on Medicare, we’re Canada. For working Americans who get insurance on the job, we’re Germany.
For the 15 percent of the population who have no health insurance, the United States is Cambodia or Burkina Faso or rural India, with access to a doctor available if you can pay the bill out-of-pocket at the time of treatment or if you’re sick enough to be admitted to the emergency ward at the public hospital.
The United States is unlike every other country because it maintains so many separate systems for separate classes of people. All the other countries have settled on one model for everybody. This is much simpler than the U.S. system; it’s fairer and cheaper, too.",askaconservative,1595992183

Lindsey Graham:

“He’s a bully,"" Graham said. ""He intimidates people by calling them bad names. Like every other bully, he’ll meet his fate only when good people say, 'Enough.' Donald Trump, enough already. Take your ball and go home.”

“I think we’ve crossed that Rubicon, where his behavior becomes about us, not just him,"" Graham said. ""I hope the party leadership will push hard. I hope that those seeking the nomination to be the standard bearer will unequivocally reject this. People gave Mr. Trump a pass on the [debate] stage. I understand that to a point, but we’ve crossed a line here that can’t be ignored. There can be no more tiptoeing around this.”

""Here's what you're buying,"" Graham continued. ""He's a race-baiting, xenophobic religious bigot. He doesn't represent my party. He doesn't represent the values that the men and women who wear the uniform are fighting for... He's the ISIL man of the year.""

&gt; A day after Hurricane Hanna pelted the Texas Gulf Coast, social media users in both the United States and Mexico began sharing tweets erroneously claiming the video showed the hurricane damaging the border wall between Texas, and the northern state of Tamaulipas in Mexico. One such video on Twitter had been viewed more than 200,000 times by Monday afternoon. A similar video on YouTube labeled, “Hurricane Hanna knocks down Trump’s Border Wall,” had received more than 40,000 views.
&gt; 
&gt; A number of news outlets on both sides of the border reported on the viral video and repeated the claim that it showed Hurricane Hanna damage.
&gt; 
&gt; “U.S. Customs and Border Protection is not aware of any border wall panels falling over due to Hurricane Hanna hitting the Rio Grande Valley Sector this past weekend,” reads a statement emailed to The Associated Press by agency spokesperson Roderick Kise. “The video circulating on social media appears to be from June 2020 when high winds caused several border wall panels that were pending additional anchoring to fall over at a construction site near Deming, New Mexico.”

I try to play them at their own game instead, and my approach is succeeding.

The good thing about that is that my gf gave up on talking about politics with me, as she feels uncomfortable when I say woke things that are too edgy even for her, when I bash the ""Karen"" privilege and repeat Louis Farrakhan's takes about whites and Jews as if I believe it, to redirect the ""flak"" against them and get them demoralized.

12,"What in the hell is ""cultural Marxism""?","So we're all aware of one of the BLM founders calling herself a ""trained Marxist"" and all, but besides that I'm not really sure how else Marxism relates to the BLM movement other than to generate trigger words for Republicans still living in the Cold War. It is to my understanding that Marxism is either a.) the economic system where workers (regardless of race/gender/sexuality/whatever) own the means of production, or. b.) the philosophy of diaclectical materialism. As far as I'm aware, Marx emphasized that race, culture and sexuality were merely part of a superstructure to distract the proletariat from the base reality of class oppression. This seems like a weird philosophy to inject into a movement so laced with identity politics.

The reason I'm asking this is that American conservatives seem to claim that the modern left is pushing a strain of ""cultural Marxism"" which allegedly aims to undermine ""traditionally"" American values. There is the idea of the Frankfurt School as a branch of Marxism which studies culture, but it's a pretty nuanced area of study that I don't think plays 100% into BLM identity politics.

Being conservative typically means that we find the rule of law good and want it evenly applied so at first glance it seems contrary to give people license to commit outright crimes and be free from prosecution. The counter point that I would raise is that such laws preserve and promote the family as no society should ever be putting a choice before its citizens between the state and their family. Also, people readily disregard this, there's dozens of instances where police officers have tipped off their children of impending arrest, parents have smuggled away fugitive children, far away siblings take them in, there was even one particularly prominent story where a mother walked into her home to discover her son was playing with their guns and had just accidentally shot and killed his friend staying over and she helped him hide the friend's corpse. So human nature itself means that against all rationality we'll risk ourselves and even take on the state for our family, hell even anecdotally I know I'd sooner risk and lose my law license than keep it by turning in one of my siblings.

There are surely liberal countries that lag behind on a few of those metrics too, but 
there is conservative countries do so much worse than liberal countries.

Surveys. Phone and internet surveys.

84,"Thoughts on the upcoming senate Republican economic relief bill (or bills), with stimulus, unemployment benefits, and more?","A draft hasn't been made public yet, but it sounds like [this here article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/zackfriedman/2020/07/22/second-stimulus-checks-new-stimulus/#3c07b5e67879) outlines what's probably going to be in the Republican proposals and what the main policy points are. With it potentially consisting of...

-Another $1,200 stimulus check, with the same requirements as the first one (so unlike the house bill, dependents above 16 are unable to get it)

-letting the $600 a week unemployment bonus expire, but implementing a smaller bonus targeting 70% wage replacement (potentially meaning a bonus of $200 to $300 a week), it's not clear how long this would last for

-potentially also a $450 a week return-to-work bonus, also not clear how long this would last for 

-seemingly no payroll tax cut

-$105 billion in school spending, with the requirement that schools re-open, it isn't clear whether this will require schools to open *in-person* or whether schools that open but move partially or fully to online format will receive less or no aid

-$0 for state and local aid

-a 5 year retroactive liability shield for businesses, protecting them from lawsuits over covid related issues

-an extension of the paycheck protection program (PPP) and possibly additional tax credits for companies that hire new employees

-an additional $16 billion for covid testing and contact tracing

Some of these things are controversial, with Democrats tending to oppose the business liability shields, the lack of aid for state and local governments, and the cutting of the $600 unemployment bonus which in particular appears to be [opposed by a number of economists](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/economists-think-congress-should-keep-paying-unemployed-workers-600-a-week-or-even-more/). On the other hand, it sounds like some Republicans may oppose even the amount of policies that other republicans seem to be proposing, with allowing even a smaller unemployment bonus seeming to be controversial, and with Trump apparently also wanting payroll tax cuts and [cuts to the CDC and covid testing](https://www.baltimoresun.com/coronavirus/ct-nw-nyt-trump-funding-covid-19-testing-cdc-20200719-35n6qxrlkvcexo7e4rg6pvbi2u-story.html)

96,Do you think Trump's upbringing as a millionaire effects his ability to understand the plight of middle-class America?,"Trump was born fabulously wealthy - in total throughout his life he received $413 million from his father. By the time he was 3 he was already worth more than a million dollars.

He's never had a regular job and he never had to get his own starting money for his initial business ventures. He's never faced any of the problems and hardships regular American's go through. Do you think this has anything to do with why he prioritized the super-wealthy on the 2018 tax bill?

As a non-supporter, Trump often seems really out of touch to me. I'll just give a couple examples here but I could find more if you'd like

In a rally in Lousiana he said ""We got more money, we got more brains, we got better houses, apartments, we got nicer boats, we’re smarter than they are, and they say they’re elite? *We’re* the elite. *You’re* the elite. We’re the elite."" - not sure what he's talking about here I don't have a boat or a house. I'd like to but I don't have lots of money.

At a rally in Florida "" ""You know, if you go out and you want to buy groceries, you need a picture on a card, you need ID."" - It makes you wonder if he's ever actually gone grocery shopping. If I were born as rich as Trump I probably wouldn't bother going to get my own groceries.

At a rally in Iowa he suggest that poor people aren't suited for positions working in his cabinet “And I love all people, rich or poor, but in those particular positions, I just don’t want a poor person... Does that make sense? If you insist, I’ll do it — but I like it better this way, right?” - do you agree with his that only rich people should be operating the highest levels of government?",askaconservative,1595613581

1) first of all, I didn’t even know this was a point of discussion. I had no idea that the norm was anyone living in the country could vote, even if they didn’t have legal status as a citizen. This blew my mind?? 

2) the article summarized that citizenship has never historically been a prerequisite for voting 
(women were citizens and weren’t allowed to vote, people who didn’t own land were citizens and weren’t allowed to vote, wealthy immigrants who owned land, etc who weren’t citizens were allowed to vote historically,  so on) 

3) that it’s hypocritical and baseless to be harping on this issue in recent years; it would take away from members of our community from having a voice, etc. 


I guess I’m not sure why I assumed only citizens could vote. (I thought illegal immigrants were committing voter fraud if/when they voted, not that it was allowed) 
I’m a little surprised and confused. It seems completely insane and inconsistent with most of the world that non-citizens can vote in any elections. 

I read that in some countries, legal residents who have resided in said country for anywhere from 1 to 15 years are allowed to vote in local elections, but that means they aren’t undocumented. 

So, what’s the deal??

54,Was Jesus a socialist?,"One source points out [flaws in this theory](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/no-jesus-was-not-a-socialist) (via [Paul M. Jones](http://paul-m-jones.com/post/2020/01/25/no-jesus-was-not-a-socialist/)):

&gt;Christians are commanded in Scripture to love, to pray, to be kind, to serve, to forgive, to be truthful, to worship the one God, to learn and grow in both spirit and character. All of those things are very personal. They require no politicians, police, bureaucrats, political parties, or programs.
&gt; 
&gt; “The poor you will always have with you, and you can help them any time you want,” says Jesus in Matthew 26:11 and Mark 14:7. The key words there are you can help and want to help. He didn’t say, “We’re going to make you help whether you like it or not.”
&gt;
&gt; In Luke 12:13-15, Jesus is approached with a redistribution request. “Master, speak to my brother that he divideth the inheritance with me,” a man asks. Jesus replied, “Man, who made me a judge or divider over you?” Then he rebuked the petitioner for his envy.
&gt; 
&gt; Christianity is not about passing the buck to the government when it comes to relieving the plight of the poor. Caring for them, which means helping them overcome it, not paying them to stay poor or making them dependent upon the state, has been an essential fact in the life of a true Christian for 2,000 years. Christian charity, being voluntary and heartfelt, is utterly distinct from the compulsory, impersonal mandates of the state.",askaconservative,1595347349

56,Why is the support for the police unwavering?,"I understand fear and anger surrounding people saying abolish the police and demanding violence against the police. I believe police are essential and most police are good/benign officers. But as a New Yorker, there are a few problems with our police force (and I think many police forces in the country) that conservatives seem to brush aside. 

1. **Violation of 4A and originalism/textualism.** The best example I can think of on this point is stop and frisk. Under Bloomberg, the NYPD was performing around 600,000 stops a year with effectively a 6% success rate (12% arrests and summons with around half being dismissed). The racial bias aspect of it is debatable (higher proportion of innocent blacks are stopped, but the effect disappears at the precinct level), but with 94% of stops being effectively innocent people wouldn't that upset you from a 4A standpoint. In Terry v. Ohio (decision that allowed for stop and frisk), the court stated that a police officer's judgement can be considered ""reasonable"" in the context of the 4A. This is the same Warren court that conservatives criticize from legislating from the bench (interestingly the court made this decision highly cognizant of the rising crime in the country). Nonetheless, it seems if 94% of stops are ill-fated then ""reason"" is not the driving factor. Furthermore, why are you okay with allowing reasonableness to effectively be loosely interpreted when you are in favor of strict construction for arms (2A), speech (1A), religion (1A), and equality (14A). To put it another way, if you are okay with police departments defining reasonableness, why are you opposed to municipalities defining arms (e.g. MacDonald v. Chicago, Heller v. D.C.), public universities defining speech (Berkeley) and states defining assembly/religion (e.g. California church ban during Covid). 
2. **Violation of 2A.** Two of the most famous cases along these lines are the police shootings of Philando Castile and Alton Sterling. Both of them were legally carrying firearms, notified the police of this and when they went to reach for their wallet, they were shot and killed. The NRA was notably silent on these issues (although I believe Colion Noir did speak about them, not certain). Aside from the more egregious cases, courts in this country have determined police officers are able to stop, frisk and disarm legal firearms owners. And we know because of the broad license given to police officers regarding stop and frisk that they can target completely innocent individuals. Are you not afraid of this power? Furthermore, a lot of conservatives complain about the stringent gun regulations in cities. How do you think these are enforced? Let's you are father in Englewood, Chicago and you are scared about the violence (which the government is not effectively combating). You decide to buy a firearm and walk your daughter to school to protect her. You technically do not have the carry license (because they are impossible to get in Chicago), but you cross state lines to get the firearm. A police officer can stop and arrest you (not sure if stop and frisk is practiced in Chicago) for simply desiring to protect your family. How are you okay with this status quo?
3. **Lack of accountability/transparency.** One of the driving forces of the Tea Party and Trump's election was to get rid of unaccountable bureaucrats who were working in the shadows to deprive Americans of their liberty. Those bureaucrats can only dream of having the license that police officers have in New York and across this country. Famously Rudy Giuliani rose to electoral fame by leading a riot of off-duty police officers (featuring racism and property damage galore) against a civilian review board that was being instituted.  Conservatives have shown support for police union leaders across the country. Meanwhile, the blue wall silence stretches across the country. In New York (until the legislation was recently changed), police complaints and discipline have been under lock and key. Derek Chauvin famously had 18 complaints against him. There are famous cases across the country of officers being fired for ""ratting"" on their fellow officers. It proves virtually impossible for the citizenry to know what police officers and hold them accountable. Police captains consistently complain about the difficulty of firing police officers. And as individual police officers are not elected, the citizenry effectively has no recourse to dealing with bad cops. 
4. **Inflated budgets.** Here's the big one. I saw a post about this earlier and the argument in favor was that police are an essential and effective function of government and conservatives only really attack unessential function. But essential functions can still have inflated budgets. What this means is that they can accomplish the goals laid out by society (i.e. x number of patrols to reduce crime by y) within a certain budget, but lobbying creates greater salaries to surpass that (I personally don't apply this to military because I believe they require $550B-$600B to meet our current commitments). In New York for example, around $11B was in the police budget comprising around 11% of the overall city budget and dwarfing all other sectors. NYPD officers are incredibly well paid as far as public officials go, earning around $85k after 5 years of service. Furthermore, they have some of the best pensions in the country, gaining it after 22 years of service and receiving upwards of $50k per year (for most cops). Pensions and other benefits comprise around half of the overall police budget (this was where the biggest chunk was cut recently). Shouldn't we ask if this is really necessary to achieve the aims that we're looking for? Pretty interesting, number of police officers and crime has remained stagnant of the past decade, while the budget has outpaced inflation. And before you tell me that the De Blasio budget cut caused the current uptick in crime, note that those cuts do not take effect until 2021. 

Sorry for the long diatribe, but those were all of my thoughts. Feel free to reply to any or all of them. I'd also be curious to hear if you agree with any of these points.",askaconservative,1595305079

70,Should the US split up in more parties,"Hi y’all hope you’re doing great! In the past time I was thinking a lot about the US political system as it is strongly displayed in my country (Switzerland). As you might know Switzerland as most European countries have a lot more than two parties (I know the US has more but only 2 with impact). Although we have some party arguments we have way less drama than you over there (sorry), which is mostly because votes are split up more, requiring parties to work more together. In the US iirc, the parties actions mostly aim to be liked by their base. I do not really observe a lot of cooperation between US parties.

Therefore I was wondering about your opinions of the following topic or if you think this topic is BS.

They have been shown to perform just as regular corporations as there are international supermarket chains that are worker co-ops. 

Worker Co-ops are subject to the same market forces as any other business, if the workers get too greedy and bankrupt the company then they will lose to other businesses that were not as greedy.

In my opinion, this has many benefits such as limiting inequality, creating a more egalitarian society while utilizing market forces. Also, from a class perspective, this would merge the working class and the wealthy.

As a hypothetical, imagine this were to be implemented in the USA, one day all corporations have to convert into worker co-ops and all new businesses need to be worker co-ops.

The bloodthirsty hate they get is wildly disproportionate to any other conservatives. Even people on the political right hate them. It just doesn’t make sense.

The theory I have, and would like to see if you guys agree, is that most conservatives fall into two categories. The ones that like Trump and are aboard the MAGA train, and the sticklers that don’t. Hannity, Limbaugh, and Charlie Kirk are aboard, and Kristol, Noonan, and Krauthammer chose not to join the movement. I feel like both MaCain and Shapiro aren’t entrenched in either side, and therefore get hate from both. The right hates them cuz they don’t fear from criticizing Trump, and the left feels like they’re showing that even people who aren’t “Trumpers” can still support his overall presidency, or at least not be against it. Shapiro certainly is a good example of this; he has repeatedly been labeled a Never-Trumper to this day despite him saying multiple times he plans on voting for Trump. MaCain, while very obviously against the person Trump, generally takes his side on policies themselves.

\- Division is at an all time high.

Forget Republican v. Democrat, thats kind of out the window.  You see large groups of people who HATE each other. this isnt 2 sides of an argument or an issue. People are diametrically opposed, and its a visceral deep-seated anger and disgust w/ those on the other side. were not debating, were not working together. The opponents are out to destroy the other side. You will get fired from your job, or counseled at work, or beaten in the street, or harrased on social media, or worse. You cant express your view, and the other side is NASTY and will use extreme means to try to root you out. 

Thats very quick/basic high level of what i see. 

Maybe its overblown? maybe its the fringe? Maybe its election season and its being propagated to fuel emotions and get people to vote a certain way? Maybe im just seeing the two most extreme versions and its exaggerated in my mind? Maybe it'll die down and people will slowly go back to status quo?

I dont see how 2 groups who cant stand each other and are fundamentally opposed cant keep together. Right now i see things brewing/building. People are getting more and more angry and fueled up on this thing. 

Im nervous. Im honestly unsure of what the future may hold. 

HERES THE QUESTION-  What happens in November when the election is decided?

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I feel thats what all the quiet conservatives are waiting for. For Trump to win, and im sure were all confident he will. Then maybe he will have guaranteed 4 years and be able to really start to try and go full powered and fix things. But idk if its that simple. There are bigger things at play that he cant control.

I think if he wins you'll see one side riot and start causing chaos. They'll give up on the system and just start trying to cause mayhem. We see the effects of that now. That cant go on. 

And if Biden or whoever wins, then itll just get worse for all the things i mentioned in the beggining. Itll just be a inal victory for all the voices that hate conservatives and everything they stand for. And more than likely no way to ever have a republican or conservative ever elected again.

Im trying to be mature and wise about all of this. And not let my emotions or the media i see influence my analysis. Please offer some insight. Thank you, God Bless.",askaconservative,1594696945

I thought maybe the post was too long, or maybe there were too many questions asked in it, so I'm going to break it up. This is one is the biggest question I was looking forward to getting answers on.

From my last post: ""why are taxes so bad? dont they pay for everything? Federal taxes go to the military, the national parks, the interstate highways, education, and fund the above safety nets. State and local taxes go to things like state highways, state parks, and supplementing local education."" 

Now this is just stuff I've learned in school so there's more to it I'm sure, but of course schools don't teach about the corruption, theft of, or reallocation of these taxes. I've also seen people online say things like ""taxation is theft"" and advocating for abolishing all taxes. But how would things get paid for? Aren't private school tuition and charter school fees really just different words for taxes?

2. You want to minimize and/or revise the regulations as some are believed to be ineffective given the objective/ intent?
3. Or, you want to keep the regulations as is, but the issue is the government's inefficiency to enforce it?  

If it's #3, would one potential solution be to have a private company to run the operations of enforcing these regulations, while the government still has the ability to set the content of  regulations and audit these ""enforcers"" to make sure they are not bribed by any regulated parties.

For additional context to my question, I’m a conservative and by no means blame Trump for this. You can honestly make a stronger case for many other groups. I’m just looking for information about instances of wrongdoing in the US COVID-19 response to better inform myself. 

I feel like I know some of the obvious ones like states requiring Nursing Homes to commit COVID-19 patients and how with “probable cases” the official count has been inflated in some states. 

However, you don’t see people mention things like Dr. Fauci and the Surgeon General Dr. Adams parroting talking points from the WHO such when they said not to wear face masks early on, when in actuality the cloth face mask recommendation should have been made way earlier than April when it was . Or how the best DIY face masks should be a thick towel and not a t-shirt, as the CDC advertised. Or how the CDC hasn’t (To my knowledge) made ads on how to wear masks properly. Personally I’ve seen people to this day who don’t cover their noses, and wear loose bandannas, stuff that goes against the CDC guidelines but isn’t made obvious to the average person. I’m sure there are many other examples out there. 

So long story short, as any conservative would do, I personally blame big government and the Federal Bureaucracy for the many of the shortcomings in the US COVID-19 response. I don’t blame the President, but I do blame the shortcomings of the individuals who drove public policy and lacked common sense in regards to the COVID-19 response. I honestly feel like they’re the only people you can blame. 

However that being said, I’m looking for other examples of failures in policy that have happened in the US at either the state or federal level that have contributed to an increase in COVID-19 numbers. And in regards to reach that end goal I ask the question, What could the US have done better in regards to responding to COVID-19?

I wonder how strong conservatives that claim that some people should leave the country as they don't ""belong there"" define this group.

Is it just by their legale statute so If they are legally citizen? That can't be as often even legal residents are targeted.

Is it family heritage, the family being US since some generations? That's also difficult, for example Mr.Trump is only third generation US, lots of big tech companies would have never existed with people streaming into the US in early 1900. Technological advance and superiority of IS would never exist without the people coming in during or after WW2.

This worldview often leads conservatives to accuse liberals of wanting 'communism'.

I was wondering for you personally, do you use 'communism' as a pejorative term, or do you actually believe that democrats are communists? If so, please give your personal definition of communism.

I have to say, as a liberal I disagree with communism myself. I do know a couple people who unironically think communism would be a good idea for the US, though they are really far left.

36,Fund the Police,"Just wanted to share my thoughts on how hypocritical and fallible liberals are acting as of now. 

My biggest point of dissension right now is in the defund the police movement (although that word seems too nice for how cruel they are acting). By trying to defund the police, liberals are essentially trying to remove enforcers of law and order. If law and order are not maintained, anarchy seeps through. And, if anarchy reigns (which is clearly shown with rioting, under a false pretense of “peaceful protesting”), then wouldn’t that be an act of terrorism?

If removing the police creates a sense of panic and pushes for a situation like the Purge, then terroristic action is being made.

The fact that liberals do not recognize their desire to overthrow the government (police are government-funded) and being upset with the police shows how divided the country has become. 

We need to support the police, thank them for their service, make sure to follow the Law to the letter to ensure that police are not stressed or having to look over a lot of infractions. 

I want to also mention that if police are defunded, if a child gets lost, a parent won’t find a good source of resource to locate a missing child. Without police, our way of life becomes vastly more evil and selfish.

If a petition would help, I want to be part of it. If we need to write a letter to our government, I will do so.

What do you think about this (de)fund the police situation? How can we help the police? What should happen with the rioters? Should those that have mentioned on social media to defund the police face terroristic charges?",askaconservative,1594218111

I’ll explain what I mean by this. I recently found out that a lot of republicans don’t think of FDR as a particularly good president. I found this really shocking because I grew up being taught he was one of the greatest Americans ever and an absolute hero, maybe even the greatest president, with the possible exception of Abraham Lincoln.

Are there another ways like this in which the republican view of the world is completely different ? Do you guys have completely different American heroes ? Like we have FDR and Martin Luther King Junior and Lincoln do you guys have like Nixon or Reagan or some confederate general ? And do you find the idea we don’t consider them heroes just as ridiculous as we find the idea you don’t consider FDR a hero ?

What about like media ? While we think of like the beatles or the Rolling Stones as the greatest musicians ever, do you guys give the title to some country musician ? And hold him in the same regard as we hold the beatles ?

Also do you guys watch completely different movies and tv shows ? I don’t think you guys would like most of the movies and tv shows that  are considered popular among democrats, since they all have fairly liberal values.

Do you guys have your own movie industry running in parallel to Hollywood with your own stars, etc. making more conservative-minded media ? are there tv channels for conservatives that air conservatives-centric shows ?

56,What's the conservative take on ICE's policy for international students during the pandemic?,"Monday, [ICE announced a modification to its COVID-19-related exemptions for international students studying in the US.](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/506072-ice-tells-students-on-visas-they-must-leave-us-if-schools-go-online) International students previously (pre-COVID) were allowed to take a limited number of online courses while residing in the US. ICE suspended this rule during the Spring and Summer semester, but plans to reinstate it for the Fall. Explicitly, international students who take an entirely online course load must leave the US to maintain their legal status. This is likely to be a concern for universities who are planning to be mostly or entirely online in the Fall due to the pandemic.

I would like the conservative perspective on this move.

In my mind, there are two *possible* explanations:

1. The executive either thinks that COVID-19 is a sufficiently reduced threat, or wants it to seem like a significantly reduced threat, so that we return to normal as soon as possible. This rule change is either a step towards normalcy or a way to pressure schools into *acting* as if things are normal.
2. The executive wants to expel immigrants in whatever way is convenient and plausible. This rule was already in place, so the executive can say, ""you weren't complaining about the rule then!"" while ignoring the consequences.

Now, I don't think that 2 is true. I cannot imagine wanting to expel, for instance, graduate students in STEM who plan to stay in the US. Preventing unskilled laborers from entering the US? Sure, I can see that, but highly skilled researchers? I don't buy it.

What's the conservative take on this? Are there legitimate reasons to reinstate this rule amid growing concerns about the pandemic? If, say, a large number of graduate students are temporarily expelled as a result, is this a good thing from the conservative view?",askaconservative,1594102046

3,What is a conservative response to the criticisms of Lysander Spooner?,"Lysander Spooner (1808-1887) was an American writer, political philosopher and entrepreneur, among other things. In 1844 he founded the American Letter Mail Company as a challenge to the legal monopoly of the United States Post Office, which charged extortionist rates. When legal challenges from the government put him out of business, he developed anarchist leanings and became a strong critic of the Constitution, being quoted in *No Treason: The Constitution of No Authority* as saying:

&gt;“\[W\]hether the Constitution really be one thing, or another, this much is certain - that **it has either authorized such a government as we have had, or has been powerless to prevent it.** In either case it is unfit to exist.”

and; *(I lightly edited this quote for readability. The full quote is easily found on Goodreads.)*

&gt;“\[W\]e have what purports to be a contract - the Constitution - made eighty years ago, by men who are now all dead, and who never had any power to bind us, but which has nevertheless bound three generations of men, consisting of many millions, and which will be binding upon all the millions that are to come; but **which nobody ever signed, sealed, delivered, witnessed, or acknowledged**; and which few persons, compared with the whole number that are claimed to be bound by it, have ever read, or even seen, or ever will read, or see.”

and,

&gt;“No man can rightfully be required to join, or support, an association **whose protection he does not desire**.”

That last one seems to resonate with the general conservative view of unionization. Spooner was also known as a strong abolitionist and supported the right of secession to be considered non-treasonous.

It never goes deeper than that though, the person or the institution is trustworthy just because they have the accreditation. You try to get into the methodology, how they reach their conclusions, most leftists can't tell you. They can't tell you how statistics are compiled, they can't tell you where their history was sourced from, they can't tell if a news article practiced good journalism or not, they can't tell you the biases or flaws of the institutions or people they trust, and it comes up constantly in their thinking. Remember when all 17 intelligence agencies agreed trump colluded with Putin? Who was in those agencies? Who do they vote for? Did they have a reason to lie?

What I'm generally seeing from the media has been a disaster with anchors blasting each other with pretty much no cases where one side hears the other side out and maybe ending with a, ""Oh, I guess I never thought of it that way. It does make sense when you explain it like that"".

Again, I'm left-leaning so I've been partial towards left-leaning news so I have a stronger understanding of their viewpoints. That is not to say that I believe the liberal argument is more valid. I'm genuinely confused at this point due to the division and would like some clarity.

I understand I'm generalizing here but here is my understanding for each side:

From the liberals:

\- History shows very few cases of voter fraud.

\- The Republicans are trying to suppress votes because they know they can't win if majority of the people vote.

\- Republicans trying to put US citizens in danger by make them go to physical polling location in the midst of a pandemic.

From the conservatives:

\- There is a high chance for voter fraud.

\- Liberals are using the second wave as an excuse to make a case for mail-in voting so they can rig the election in their favor.

I'm aware that the majority of folk are asymptomatic, and it attacks the small percentage of vulnerable and elderly. I also want to preface this question by saying the republicans I'm referring to are two friends of mine.

Wherever I speak with these two friends about the current state of things, the first thing they say to me is its overblown, cases are over reported, doctors are counting normal deaths as coronavirus deaths, and that the left is blowing this out of proportions.

Yet whenever I look up the things they say I find that the CDC has, and has always had, methods of ensuring a virus death is confirmed to be a virus death and not something else through lab tests, and that deaths involving corona but can't be identified strictly as corona are listed as probable deaths. I saw that they released a few statements reiterating this after all the talk of taking coronavirus deaths. And I see that if it really was just the left exaggerating it, why has there been a global response to it of this magnitude? I would get that argument if it was just the United States shutting down and taking precautions.

Whenever I have conversations with them about this kinda stuff, and I google and see government statistics disproving what they say, I'm inclined to believe that it's their beliefs that are politicizing corona virus. I'm not very political so I'm not saying all the right is bad or anything like that, but I wanted to ask this question here to see if there's some more rational  reasoning behind these beliefs.",askaconservative,1593761821

On the other hand she's a bit too sympathetic to some leftist issues like the confederate flag when she was governor during the Dylann roof shooting etc, and recently she was quick to jump in and believe Bubba Wallace's noose story and condemn imaginary white racists. I'm not sure she's the best Republican presidential candidate.

Websites that people consider over-censoring like reddit or twitter often have a large left population but also a good bit of right.

They would govern as a team with one as president one as VP with the president only making time sensitive decisions alone, and if they absolutely cannot come to agreement then as well. After four years they will be able to switch with VP now as President and continue the next four years, unless someone new is voted in.

I am an ex-mormon with conservative parents and I’ve grown up left-leaning because of it. My old religion (regardless of what you believe about Mormonism, I believe is a cult) is what drove me away from supporting Conservative ideas. I also identify as being attracted to both genders, so the Mormon church’s support to stifle marriage was a huge turn off for me.

To me, religion is good for some people. People find God and their salvation in times of stress, loss of a loved one, or even trying to kick back addiction. 

However, I do believe that religion isn’t good in government. I support our constitutional rights given to us, Freedom of Speech, Freedom of Assembly, the second amendment and Freedom of Religion. I don’t think that religion should be tied in a true and fair system, especially in the modern era. Religion was used as a tool to control large populations and give a moral compass for those without their own. We have thousands of religions, and aetheists as well. Shouldn’t we have a government that reflects the whole of America, religious and non-religious, and not have legislature tied up in Christian beliefs? 

Or do you believe that is what our country was founded on, the God given rights afforded us in the Constitution? 

Apologies for not sourcing specific legislature that supports Christian ideas, I think there’s other evidence that supports this. “In God we trust” for example, and the Pledge of Allegiance.",askaconservative,1593542073
88,"Monuments aside, Trump defended the names of US military institutions. Why?","I understand the whole history erasure thing.  But when it comes to Fort Bragg, for example, it starts to get a little confusing to me. General Braxton Bragg fought for the confederacy. He was a traitor against the United States. So that’s already kind of weird that we would name a US military based after him. He also then lost the war so in terms of Trump’s statement regarding how these forts are part of a “history of winning, victory, and freedom” he actually literally embodied none of those 3 things as a military leader. And as for the idea of “well he was an american general before he became a traitor”, technically Osama Bin Laden was an ally to US interests when he was fighting against the soviets as a Mujahideen, but no one made any excuses for him after he turned against the US/The West as a whole. I understand that theres many factors that make the two cases different, but I’m just using that as an example that we as a nation dont seem to have a penchant for traitor apologism, it seems like we are just making excuses for confederates. I guess at the end of the day the fact that people want our soldiers training at a fort named after a general of an opposing military force kinda baffles me.

In addition what would be ways to decrease the cost so people who can’t get medicare can afford it? I think the best would be some sort of hybrid system. Where people can have private insurance if they happy with their current system and it will be a lot faster than being on a single payer system. As well as a public option like medicare for all. However, in a country with 350 million it will be a very slow system so I think that’s its best handled as a state issue and a hybrid system would be best.

For example, half our country believed blacks were not human and it took a war and a law imposing morality to change that, so either consensus is not needed, or that law was unjust as it imposed some sort of morality.

22,Why have conservatives ceased to conserve anything anymore?,"Greetings Conservatives, a pleasure to be here. We are Realtalk, a small radio show and for today, we have chosen to discuss why conservatives seem to no longer conserve anything anymore. 

It isn’t exactly outrageous to say that the far left today is stronger and more out of control than it has been in years. Whether it be the rioters in the USA or Marxist agents who have successfully subverted education, media, entertainment and perhaps more importantly government worldwide: they control the narrative. Yet we know from numerous election victories that that conservatism is seemingly also on the rise in terms of popularity with the average Joe. 

So why is it then that in recent years apart from outspoken well known conservatives such as Ben Shapiro, hardly anyone seems to bother even attempting to push conservative ideas? Perhaps more succinctly, why do conservatives seem to conserve nothing anymore? There is virtually zero proper progress in reversing Marxist takeovers of institutions and it is as if some issues, such as abortion, are almost totally surrendered. When in the USA, a so called bastion of conservative ideas, is having statues torn down and vandalised by bandits, why do conservatives just seem to sit back and let it happen? 

From my view, conservatives by nature are just too polite and need to realise that if they do not get their act together, there won’t be anything left to conserve.

I'm left-leaning, I can admit there are some major dumb-sounding idiots on this side that IMO destroy what I believe are liberal values (e.g antifa etc.), there are many who would share the same views as me. And it makes me cringe to see these idiots on TV or the Media, regardless if it's a pro or against their points. They just overall paint a negative picture.

I often see that these dumb idiots are often talked about or shared in right-wing subreddits to show how dumb the left is, I'm curious how you view it when dumb people on your side do the same thing?

Of course, I presume, we'd be on the same page; that we do not support the idiots who hijack our political media platforms and do not want them to represent our movements. With that said, you often see (not surprising here) dumb bandwagon supporters/apologists who acknowledge these said idiots (this will always be the case).

Both sides think they uphold the truth and all, though the people on the right end of the spectrum are for more likely to say that their ""news"" or ""information"" is real and isn't fake news. I mean this could be the equivalent of liberal idiots saying ""You're just brainwashed/racist/homophobic etc."", so how do you guys on your platform take into account these idiots whilst you yourself uphold the belief that the ""right"" are more conscious of the real truth than the left?

In the US at least, it looks like you guys as a nation have one of the dumbest socio-political atmosphere/theater ever. Both sides look like a fucking joke haha.

If abortion is made illegal again, then isn't it a fact that far more dangerous, harmful, unsafe abortions will take place? This cannot possibly be considered pro-life, because instead of safe abortions that end in the death of the baby and the life of the mother, unsafe abortions, ""coat hanger abortions"", will result in harm to both, and perhaps even death to both. Neither option is pro-life. Then what is the pro-life solution? Conservatives and all pro-lifers must recognize that the issue is not all black and white and clear-cut, but that there needs to be more done than simply outlawing abortion. Don't get me wrong, I believe abortions should never happen, but how can we end all abortions, both legal and illegal. Conservatives have rejected the ideas of universal healthcare and constantly attack groups like planned parenthood, which while they do give/support abortions they also help with pregnancies and health.

Consequently, industry leaders like GitHub and the Houston Association of Realtors are discontinuing use of these terms.

&gt;JEFFERSON COUNTY — Letter from County Judge Jeff Branick to the Citizens and Media of Jefferson County:  
&gt;  
&gt;I recognized when I entered the mandatory mask order that there would be people who would not like it. What I didn’t expect was the level of pure hatred and profanity laden messages that would make a sailor blush. That’s okay, it comes with the territory. What has been most disappointing to me has been the level of insistence by many that my orders are a direct affront to their constitutional rights. The U.S. Supreme Court, since 1794, after the Whiskey Rebellion, and times since has repeatedly held that these types of orders are allowed in certain circumstances and are, in fact, constitutional. Those who say otherwise are misinformed or are depending on Natural law, not Constitutional law. I have not asked people to lay down their arms, surrender their right to free speech or to be subject to having soldiers quartered in their homes, I’ve asked them to suffer the inconvenience of placing a 4x6” piece of material over their mouth and nose when in a business to protect their friends and neighbors. Individuals who seem to have no problem with a restaurant requiring shoes and a shirt go ballistic over a business asking them to wear a mask.  
&gt;  
&gt;Eighty years ago, the greatest generation planted victory gardens, collected tin, rubber and steel, had food ration books and endured black outs, all to support the war effort. Their sacrifices were significantly more weighty than the inconvenience the present order requires. I want to thank a fellow county judge for reminding me of this. Today, a small minority is screaming that this is some kind of communist plot to overthrow the nation. When did it happen that we all became so focused on our rights and not our obligations to our fellow man and woman? Jesus said “Greater love has no man than this, that he lay down his life for his friends”. I’m not directing anyone to lay down their life. Galatians 6:2 says “Carry each other’s burdens and in this way you will fulfill the Law of Christ”. I love you, because that is what Christ teaches us to do.  
&gt;  
&gt;I wear a mask not because I am afraid but because it is one way of showing that I care about my neighbors. There is a lot we don’t know about COVID-19 but all the evidence suggests that wearing a mask helps to prevent the spread of the virus. If wearing a mask prevents one person from dying, then isn’t it worth the minor inconvenience? If wearing a mask helps us get our country and economy back to normal, then isn’t it our patriotic duty to do so?” I received this in an email from an Orange County resident. It is a note he keeps in his pocket which he gives to people who make snide remarks about his wearing a mask in stores.  
&gt;  
&gt;Based on my conversations with numerous physicians, directives from the president of the Texas Medical Association, the thoughts of the head of the Department of state health services, and many others in the medical field, masks can prevent the spread of the virus. Might we find out next year after peer reviewed studies that such is not the case? Can I find a YouTube video from an OSHA inspector that supports the opposite view? Yes to both questions. But we are in the midst of the largest spread that we have seen thus far, and to prevent another shutdown of “nonessential” businesses and to keep our hospital system from becoming overwhelmed I am acting on the best available information. Those “nonessential” businesses have families to feed and mortgages to pay and I want them to be able to do that without having to worry if they are at some point going to have to depend on unemployment benefits, if they are even available to them. I will lift the order as soon as I possibly can, but in the meantime I pray for your cooperation.

I’m wondering though if these may have hurt Trump when he went into politics. Obviously liars have no problem breaking the promise they made when they agreed to the NDA.

Instead, they spend it on things like real estate investment, stocks, and bonuses, or they don't spend it at all. And the other 15 spent less than 10% of their endowment on average from 2012 onward. These endowments average $19.6 billion a year, and some universities, like Harvard, have a bigger endowment than some countries. At the same time, because they claim to be 'non-profit', all that money is non-taxable. Universities have increased spending on amenities to attract rich students who can pay their full tuition, and have started admitting fewer and fewer lower income students, whose families make less than $30,000 a year. The number of adjunct, or temporary professors has risen exponentially since 1980, while the number of tenured professors and the number of scholarships have both gone down.

Hi,

I just wanted to ask a question about any of your experiences publishing an opinion article for your college newspapers or anything of the sort. Right now, as I am sure many of you are feeling, I really think there is a mis/underepresentation of real conservative views about racial tensions and the riots, and what it all actually means in a fundamental sense for the country, its history and its future. I wanted to publish an article about why, fundamentally and philosophically, it is wrong to tear down any statue of anyone (including confederate generals). However, I am pretty deathly afraid of getting ""cancelled."" I know this is no excuse to stay silent, but I can't help but think that maybe I would rather keep myself safe and able to actually stay in college lest I get kicked out because a bunch of people call the administration asking that I get removed or something. My question is, should I continue on with writing this article? Has anyone had experiences like this one? I don't want to post information about which college in particular for reasons I explained above, but I am relatively certain that the newspaper I'll be writing for is pretty good on being independent and publishing both sides, but I know a lot of students are not that tolerant.

Any input would be appreciated, I am really trying to find a way to express some voice in a time that I believe conservatives and republicans are struggling

This doesn't line up with claims that the modern Democratic Party is the same as the one that supported slavery and Jim crow in the past.

For instance, marilyn Manson has a song called The Nobodies where he mocks society and the media for viewing school shootings as a spectacle, he has another song called Get Your Gunn where he sings about Conservative terrorist attacks on abortion clinics, and 1996 where he calls the Pope a faggot.

Then there's System Of A Down, their lead singer and writer, Serj, is a socialist and he puts many socialist messages in their music, in the song Suite Pee he talks about priest molesting children and how the church should be abolished, in Toxicity he sings about pollution and global warming destroying the earth, and in Prison Song he talks about drug crimes being over-enforced and innocent drug users suffering and being murdered in prison.

They tore down statues of Thomas Jefferson, George Washington, Ulysses S Grant who literally accepted the surrender of the Confederacy and a Norwegian immigrant who was a abolitionist in Wisconsin and last but not least, Mount Rushmore. Corporations are also pandering to BLM and we have gotten rid of Aunt Jemima pancake mix, Winn Dixie wants to drop the word ""Dixie"" from its name because it represents the south, which is now offensive and The dixie chicks are changing their name to the chick's, lady antebellum changed their name to Lady A.

You send your kid to a government institution for 8 hours, then when they come home they go on social media and get bombarded with more leftists propoganda, which leads to the story I shared. If you have a kid, it only belongs to you in writing, the state, and left wing Hollywood shape their minds, and are increasingly setting them against their family. Shouldn't be that way, your kids should have your values, but in order to do that you have to spend time with your kids, leftism has made that increasingly harder.

I was only 15 when I had found out who he was, and went to his 12 Rules for Life tour a couple months later with my uncle.

They rather consume their news and information through Instagram posts and twitter feeds without finding out more of a truth to it.

54,Conservative alternatives to GoFundMe,"Earlier this month the crowdfunding platform GoFundMe cancelled a fundraiser organised by Candace Owens of Turning Point USA. The money was being raised on behalf of a Birmingham, Alabama business called the Parkside Cafe, whose owner Michael Dykes had expressed frustration at not being able to open normal operating hours due to the recent protests around the neighbourhood.

Although the $200,000 that had been raised up to that point did go to the business, GoFundMe released a bizarre statement after the cancellation accusing Owens of ""*spreading hate, discrimination, intolerance and falsehoods against the black community at a time of profound national crisis*"".

Not only was the claim not true, it is a blatant example of virtue-signalling to appease a leftist narrative with no regard for a business owner trying to make an honest living.

Going forward this begs the question of how conservatives, or anybody who dissents from the 'woke' mentality, can support the causes they want without being targeted by mob mentality in this way. Against a backdrop of social media harassment and censorship, it feels like an orchestrated attempt to silence and starve conservative causes.

55,Why is 2A such a pillar of conservatism?,"So, I'm not a gun owner, but from talking and listening to friends and family who are gun owners (some responsible, some not so much) and from reading through this sub, I understand that gun ownership seems to be the biggest pillar of true conservatism. 
Some friends talk about hunting, sportsmanship, and being genuinely interested in collecting guns - this I get and totally support (I'm not a hunter - but not opposed at all, just never had the opportunity). 
Some talk about defending themselves from a vague, undefined threat (an intruder, an aggressive interloper, etc).
Other friends (family too) talk about ""defending themselves when the government comes to take their guns"". None of these people have any military or weapons tactic training that seems like it would be rather important to have in order to resist something like that. 
One thing I take away from all of this is a strong emphasis on personal freedom and self-reliance. I would have no problem understanding any of that, if it didn't fly in the face of other conservative tenants, like Christianity (Christ was non-violent to the point of death, preached love of all no matter what, and spoke of turning the other cheek) and of the need for conservatives to control other choices that people can make for themselves (""war"" on drugs, anti-abortion, deep desire to control social norms, etc)
My thoughts lead to to consider that if we had a greater participation in the democratic procedures, more cooperation on a local/state/national scene, many of the issues regarding ""protection"" could be solved without the potential for bloodshed.

&gt; The British government has always been evasive about the presence of munitions on Lusitania. Two cargo manifests were submitted; the second, filed after the ship sailed, indicated there were light munitions on board. Some believe the ship was carrying much more, however, and that the British Navy attempted to destroy the wreck in the 1950s to conceal its military cargo.
&gt; 
&gt; Now a team led by County Waterford-based diver Eoin McGarry, on behalf of Lusitania's American owner, Gregg Bemis, has recovered live ammunition from the wreck. Bemis was granted a five-year license in 2007 by the Irish government to conduct limited excavations at the site. He originally bought the vessel in 1968 for $2,400 from the Liverpool &amp; London War Risks Insurance Association.
&gt; 
This past September, Bemis's team used a remotely operated vehicle to penetrate the wreck. They were able to clearly identify a vast amount of ammunition in an area of Lusitania not believed to have carried cargo. The Remington .303 caliber bullets the team discovered on the ship had been used by the British military during World War I. Ten of the bullets were brought to the surface. 

[WW2](https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/united-states-freezes-japanese-assets):

&gt; On July 24, Tokyo decided to strengthen its position in terms of its invasion of China by moving through Southeast Asia. Given that France had long occupied parts of the region, and Germany, a Japanese ally, now controlled most of France through Petain’s puppet government, France “agreed” to the occupation of its Indo-China colonies. Japan followed up by occupying Cam Ranh naval base, 800 miles from the Philippines, where Americans had troops, and the British base at Singapore.
&gt; 
&gt; President Roosevelt swung into action by freezing all Japanese assets in America. Britain and the Dutch East Indies followed suit. The result: Japan lost access to three-fourths of its overseas trade and 88 percent of its imported oil. Japan’s oil reserves were only sufficient to last three years, and only half that time if it went to war and consumed fuel at a more frenzied pace. Japan’s immediate response was to occupy Saigon, again with Vichy France’s acquiescence. If Japan could gain control of Southeast Asia, including Malaya, it could also control the region’s rubber and tin production—a serious blow to the West, which imported such materials from the East. Japan was now faced with a dilemma: back off of its occupation of Southeast Asia and hope the oil embargo would be eased—or seize the oil and further antagonize the West, even into war.

[And](https://www.independent.org/news/article.asp?id=1930)

&gt; When Franklin D. Roosevelt became president in 1933, the U.S. government fell under the control of a man who disliked the Japanese and harbored a romantic affection for the Chinese because, some writers have speculated, Roosevelt’s ancestors had made money in the China trade.[1] Roosevelt also disliked the Germans (and of course Adolf Hitler), and he tended to favor the British in his personal relations and in world affairs. He did not pay much attention to foreign policy, however, until his New Deal began to peter out in 1937. Afterward, he relied heavily on foreign policy to fulfill his political ambitions, including his desire for reelection to an unprecedented third term.
&gt; 
&gt; When Germany began to rearm and to seek Lebensraum aggressively in the late 1930s, the Roosevelt administration cooperated closely with the British and the French in measures to oppose German expansion. After World War II commenced in 1939, this U.S. assistance grew ever greater and included such measures as the so-called destroyer deal and the deceptively named Lend-Lease program. In anticipation of U.S. entry into the war, British and U.S. military staffs secretly formulated plans for joint operations. U.S. forces sought to create a war-justifying incident by cooperating with the British navy in attacks on German U-boats in the north Atlantic, but Hitler refused to take the bait, thus denying Roosevelt the pretext he craved for making the United States a full-fledged, declared belligerent—an end that the great majority of Americans opposed.
&gt; 
&gt; [T]he Roosevelt administration, while curtly dismissing Japanese diplomatic overtures to harmonize relations, imposed a series of increasingly stringent economic sanctions on Japan. In 1939 the United States terminated the 1911 commercial treaty with Japan. “On July 2, 1940, Roosevelt signed the Export Control Act, authorizing the President to license or prohibit the export of essential defense materials.” Under this authority, “[o]n July 31, exports of aviation motor fuels and lubricants and No. 1 heavy melting iron and steel scrap were restricted.” Next, in a move aimed at Japan, Roosevelt slapped an embargo, effective October 16, “on all exports of scrap iron and steel to destinations other than Britain and the nations of the Western Hemisphere.” Finally, on July 26, 1941, Roosevelt “froze Japanese assets in the United States, thus bringing commercial relations between the nations to an effective end. One week later Roosevelt embargoed the export of such grades of oil as still were in commercial flow to Japan.”[2] The British and the Dutch followed suit, embargoing exports to Japan from their colonies in southeast Asia.",askaconservative,1592916744

The successor would have to be a much more unifying figure but still have some of that right wing populism rhetoric (IMO). I personally believe Tucker Carlson is a perfect choice for a number of reasons. He is an elitist who cares about the working class, his rhetoric and talking points are just like Trumps but better formulated and not as offensive and most importantly, he has an established name (and face) and also a huge media outreach. I believe that one of the most important ways to keep the GOP alive is to keep the rust belt states as red states. Tucker could manage to do that better than for instance Rand Paul, who I ideologically agree with much more than Tucker, but we all know that politics is mostly optics.

11,"Your Reactions to Trump's Visa, Green Card Freeze","I'm curious about conservatives' reactions to Trump's freeze of Green cards and several Visas, specifically H-1 visas. 

He cited the rising unemployment in the US, but it appears that this will not make a big effect on unemployment. Green cards are for those who have worked within the US for years and their families. I'd argue that they have earned that green card and taking away their opportunity is ineffective. 

H-1 visas, which are for professionals and highly skilled workers, would not ""open up"" jobs that were lost due to the pandemic. A large majority of those jobs lost were for those without a degree or were not professional. Suspending H-1 visas would not reduce unemployment significantly to warrant screwing over so many immigrants.

As a liberal, I hear that conservatives are okay with immigrants, but want them to come in legally, but if we keep making it harder and harder to legally enter the US, it will only increase the amount of illegal immigrants.

Whenever I have asked conservatives what solutions they propose, it has *always* resolved to either ""I don't care"" or ""*somehow* have homeless and poor people get a job, or another job.""

  
In 2018, homeless rate was 0.2% of population, or 17 people per 10,000. In coronavirus times these numbers have exploded, and we don't know how bad it will get or for how long.

When I was young, my dad said that the welfare program was put in place because we as a people decided to take care of our sick, old, and disabled. As jobs change and are replaced by machines, is it time we consider taking care of our mentally unwell, unskilled, uneducated, and maybe even our lazy? Should a line be drawn somewhere for people we *don't* care to help?

We take care of our dangerous and societal defectors in prison. Personally I don't really want anyone to *starve* in America for any reason, and I don't think ""begging"" is suitable or consistent survival income for people who have deeper problems.

Does America have a troubled history where race was often a prominent issue? Of course. I'm not denying that. But that is very different than saying that America was founded on racism. 

In light of events this week, we see what college indoctrination has done to our young people. The craziness of the campus has boiled over into the real world and I think threatens our society greatly. What's more,  an entire generation of young people will be taught that America is a racist society and the only thing that is important in life is your tribal ethnic affiliation.

I keep telling myself that Twitter and Reddit aren’t reflective of reality but I’m not so sure now. I’m a freshman in college doing ROTC, and with recent events I’ve started to doubt joining the Army. Maybe I’m overreacting but I don’t want to serve a country that is turning Into a place that silences our freedoms and bows to the mob, which kills me because it’s the only thing I’ve ever wanted to do.

1. Random ghetto violence sends bullets through neighborhood
2. An innocent, usually female, is killed
3. This innocent is an honor student or otherwise notable or exceptional person

And here we have the trifecta:

&gt; 
&gt; When she was still a senior at Hillhouse, Brown spoke to a Register reporter about a student athlete study program there, noting she often left practice tired, so she liked having most of her homework done before she arrived at home

I’m curious about what most conservatives think about making police training more comprehensive.

For example, to be a medical professional, it takes usually 4 years of undergrad and 2+ years in the appropriate school per field and 2+ residency. 
To be a lawyer, you need 4 years undergrad and law school and passing the Bar. 
I’m an engineering student and even to be a professional engineer I need a 4 year degree, passing an exam, then another 4 years under a professional engineer then another exam. (This is so I can sign off on engineering plans and can be liable for damages if anything goes awry). 

It currently takes under a year to become a police officer. With all that their job entails, would you support increasing the time it takes to become a police officer in order to increase their training in de-escalation, psychology, criminal justice, self defense (something like having a black belt in a martial art) and firearms? 

Would you support something like a police license similar to the bar or license to practice? The idea is to hold police officers to a higher standard and keep the bad ones from joining another agency after they’re fired.

0,Help Surgeon Find A Home!,"Hello all,

Could you give a young, conservative surgeon some ideas of where to settle down in a number of years? All of your suggestions will be researched and well appreciated. Thank you.

**a) Population/Size:** I would prefer a mid-sized city/suburb, with an at least somewhat larger city nearby (within \~1 hour). *Ex: Suburbs of Nashville or Knoxville, TN.*

**b) Economy/Cost of Living:** A relatively low cost of living and reasonable taxes would be ideal. I work extremely hard and I would like to see more of my money at the end of the day. I am not too concerned about actually finding a job so do not worry about that.

**c) Family/Education:** I am young, and hoping to start a family at some point, so this area should be ideal for raising a family. Strong education system is a must. I prefer a strong public or public-charter education system over private or private-religious schools. I like good teachers and I will support good public schools.

**d) Politics/Policy:** Gun friendly and less governmental control, please. The academic Northeast is stifling. I get along with most everybody, but I am conservative, and I would prefer an area where I can raise children around good people that share similar values. A relatively stable area is ideal – I know you fine folks can’t predict the future, but a more conservative area that is likely to stay conservative would be great.

**e) Activities:** Big into the outdoors – off-roading, hiking, running, camping, kayaking, etc. I would love to live in a town surrounded by nature. Having mountains nearby, would be nice. Good restaurants/food would be great, but I enjoy cooking. If you want to make me happy, I do love Mexican. Not into nightlife, rather be asleep or cutting.

**f) Climate:** I like seasons. I dislike extremes (think Alaska, Arizona). Not picky otherwise.

**g) Crime:** low crime area surrounded by low crime areas, please.

**h) Housing:** I would like a decently appointed home, and I do want to own some land (at least an acre or two, ideally 5+). I am fine building or buying but would enjoy affordability in housing. I would probably prefer building, so somewhere I could find a plot of land that wouldn't be too difficult to connect to utilities would be great. Planning on solar if the region allows, not a deal breaker.

It's rather concerning to me. Sure, save for the last two months the country hasn't gone up in flames, so maybe the positions aren't as important as the titles would like us to think, but I still find it concerning.

There are better examples than what he's said about Bolton; it's just the most recent, and I don't think he explicitly said Bolton was never good, but if I recall I think he said things along those lines about his secretary of state and at least two other close, high-ranking people.",askaconservative,1592544529

My question is that since the Republican party tends to be a supporter of big business and relatively unregulated capitalism, who do so few conservatives live in the city?

I get that there are a few reasons why demographically, big cities are so liberal. Poor people in cities tend to vote Democrat,  and poor people in rural areas tend to vote Republican. Also cities tend to have different demographics such as more minorities, more LGBT people, less religious people, more educated people and younger people, all demographics that usually vote for Democrats. Still, this doesn't explain why the political demographics of these cities are so lopsided.

In 2016, Trump only received 10% of the vote from his hometown, Manhattan. You're telling me that only 10% of people that live in Manhattan want lower taxes, stricter law enforcement, and less governmental regulation on business in the financial capital of the world?

I get there are demographic reasons why cities are predominately liberal. Still, I can't comprehend why there are so few conservatives that live in cities. Anecdotally, there were a lot more conservatives than liberals that I knew growing up that eventually moved to cities for economic opportunity, but this doesn't seem like a trend nationally at all.

44,Why no silent liberal effect?,"Most of us have probably heard of the ""silent majority,"" ""shy Tory,"" or some such phrase. For those who haven't it's essentially the principle that there are many people who support and vote for a certain cause/politician without expressing their support, often leading to an electoral result in stark contrast to what one might have suspected given the predominant opinion before the election. 

The ""silent majority"" effect has often come into play for conservatives/right wingers in general, even spawning the similar meaning term ""shy Tory"" in the UK. It was arguably a large factor that played into Trump's 2016 win despite opinion polls showing him being down by several points up until the night of the election. 

However the reverse rarely seems true. I cannot think of a single issue/election where the majority online or opinion poll position was further to the right than the end result. This begs the question; why is there no silent liberal effect? 

The immediate possible answers to me would seem to be; A) liberals are more comfortable expressing their political opinions with pollsters/online than conservatives, B) pollsters consistently oversample liberals when conducting polls, and C) deplatforming and other movements have turned online communities into echo chambers unrepresentative of the true general stance. 

Of course this then begs the question why A, B, and C might be true.

53,A note of thanks to this sub,"Hey everyone. Today I’ve decided to delete my main Reddit account —this one will probably soon follow— and abandon all political discussion to the extent of my ability. I’d like to thank Askaconservative for remaining one of the only hubs on the internet for thought-provoking discussion and dissent throughout the several years (and multiple accounts) I participated in it.

The events of the past few months, which need no retelling, have helped me to reconsider much about the modern conservative movement and politics in general. I no longer believe that debate on Reddit is fruitful, for either the “national political consciousness” or most importantly for personal health. You probably already agree with me here. More broadly, I have become somewhat doubtful that general debate/discourse between progressives and conservatives—at least the idea of competition in a neutral arena between competing political ideologies— is at all useful, for a variety of reasons. Most of these are not originally mine, so I will not elaborate on them here. I think any engaged conservative has seen or sensed how absurd the idea of a “level playing field” is.

By contrast, I always enjoyed Askaconservative because it was, and is, a space not for mindless tit-for-tat but where philosophy, dissent and a wide variety of life experiences could be found. That said, I hope my few comments here helped someone in some way, and acknowledge that most in general have been a vain pursuit of dopamine. My own political journey has spanned from liberal to right-of-center to alt-lite to angry nationalist to calm reactionary, but I remain philosophically a conservative at heart. With this in mind, I don’t consider myself blackpilled, but clearpilled (not my coinage either). I intend to passively observe rather than attempt to influence our political reality, with the understanding that in our current society civic “action” is only perpetuating the rut we find ourselves in.

I began to think politics was a sort of game, but reconsidered, as that would imply that the participants were consciously aware of the friendly limits of their endeavor. Our politics is really more like a sport, but one where two people are locked on the field for a purpose outside their control— like a pointlessly drawn-out gladiatorial match. And we know which side is destined to win. Game or sport, the only way to win is not to play.

As a young and flawed person, there’s not much I feel fit to advise you all on, but I can point you in the direction of several political works which influenced me. Read Moldbug if you want everything to make sense. If you’re looking to shore up your faith in the conservative mindset, read Notes for the Reactionary of Tomorrow by Joseph Sobran (brought to my attention by some long-forgotten user on this sub). And if you’re looking for meaning or purpose on Reddit, turn off your computer. Those things are not to be found here.

What is so wrong with caring about other people? That’s what all the policies boil down too. We want black people to not be killed because of their skin color. We care about kids in cages (dying and disappearing) at the border all because their parents wanted a better life. We care about mothers free choice to do what she wants with her body. We care about poor people. We care about a persons right to protest without being assaulted with tear gas and rubber bullets. We care about a persons choice to marry and love and be who they want to be. We have the right to fight against injustice, no matter the manner, until it’s fixed. That is the root of leftist ideology, and to me, all I can see is that the right ideology is rooted in money.

75,Are there checks and balances to prevent the SCOTUS from legislating from the bench and are they sufficient checks?,"Regardless of one's opinion on the outcome of the recent SCOTUS decision regarding LGBT hiring, I am more than a little concerned that the majority opinion fully acknowledges that the relevant law doesn't actually say that it should extend to sexuality, but that they're reading it to be so anyway because the original writers weren't thinking of it at the time. That's all well and good but if that's the case, then the law should go through the legislature, where you need broad agreement to get things done and where the citizens can hold the legislatures accountable if they don't agree with the decision. The Supreme Court, which does not need nearly so much bipartisan agreement nor can citizens influence the sitting members in any real way should not be able to effectively read in new law. This is a case where even if I think the end point isn't the worse thing in the world, the means are awful and I don't think the ends justify the means in any circumstance.

So my question is that since government checks and balances are supposed to prevent things like this, what existing safeguards are there to prevent this from the other two branches? Are they sufficient or are we simply not leveraging them appropriately?",askaconservative,1592328560

I knew some of my friends did not support Trump but I never thought it would lead to animosity.

I never really cared that they did not support Trump, I wish they did but nothing was going to change their mind, that was my stance, but I never realized that the favor was not returned until recently.

Seeing as recent cultural revolutions have bought about increased female participation in the workforce, we're left with a state of affairs where lots of women earn lots more than men, and are far better educated. The result being, a shrinking of the pool of men that women would be willing to select from to date and have sex with.

However, I find there are people out there who really are hateful and blame, degrade, and scorn other groups. This psychology strikes me as broken somehow.

The mainstream conservative response is to deny race, and to say that if people do what our ideology of our legal and economic system says is right, then they get rewarded. However, doesn't this seem like saying, ""act like me, and you're good,"" or in other words, act like a white conservative, and we accept you?

This seems weirdly like denying who these people are and denying their right to have their own culture, which is part of pluralism or multiculturalism.",askaconservative,1591980982

68,As of 2020: Is the Right in America and the West on the brink of defeat? Or can they still recover?,"**At the start of this year, it looked as if everything was going well. The economy in America was booming, Brexit finally happened and it was looking like both Donald Trump was almost guaranteed to get reelected and Boris Johnson and the UK Tories were bound to win more future elections.** 

***That all changed when COVID-19 came along...***

When the virus began to spread, countries around the world shut their economies down and set new ""Social Distancing guidelines"" and Quarantine. In the United States alone, all the economic gains under the Trump administration were erased and to this day, over 40 million people are still unemployed. But that has not stopped the President's advisors, namely Jared Kushner and Brooke Rollins from speaking to Big Tech companies about importing more visa workers *(more on that later).*  

On top of this, after 3 months of Quarantine and Social Distancing due to COVID-19, a viral video showing the death of a man named George Floyd appeared on Facebook and YouTube, sparked protests nationwide that turned into violent riots. It took over a week for President Trump to address them. 

During that time and even now, I have NEVER seen more people supportive of Trump be so angry at the President. May it be on Twitter, Facebook or IRL, I notice that people seem to have run out of patience with the President due to all of what's transpired over this year alone. Many are angry over broken promises on immigration and so on. 

This reflects in the latest polling trends. President Trump's approval according to Gallup went from 49% to 39% in the span of a week. The RCP Average has Trump down to 42.1% approval vs. 55.1%. As the incumbent, he was trailing Biden nationally by 4-5 points nationally a few weeks ago. Now, Biden is leading Trump nationally by 8.1 points according to the RCP Average. Much of this is due to Trump's response to the riots according to pollsters. 

In the key swing states, Trump is losing to Biden in all except for 2 of them. Biden is leading in Florida, Arizona and Wisconsin by 3.4%, Pennsylvania by 3.3% and Michigan by 7.3%. 

The polling trends, not necessarily the polls themselves show that while Trump has made significant gains among Hispanic, Black and Asian voters, he's losing White voters in droves and for the reasons mentioned above. 

It's not looking good for the Senate Republicans either. They're embracing the Left's talking points when it comes to police brutality and have met with the White House to discuss Police Reform, another bloated stimulus package and a DACA Amnesty bill which Jared Kushner has been discussing with Lindsay Graham about getting passed prior to the election in November.

Currently, Suzanne Collins, Thom Tillis, Martha McSally and even Mitch McConnell have been polled losing to their Democratic opponents. With David Purdue of Georgia losing in the polls to Jon Ossoff.. 

Should this keep up, we could be witnessing a repeat of 2008 or worse 1992 all over again...

Meanwhile abroad, due to Hong Kong's autonomy being stripped by the govt. of Beijing, Boris Johnson has decided to give amnesty anyone living in Hong Kong who wish to come to the U.K. That's over 2 million people.  

A recent YouGov Poll recently showed that BoJo's approval rating has plummeted to 43% and now has a 50% disapproval. 

Both the Opium and Survation polls have recently has been showing the U.K. Conservative and Labour Parties nearly tied. 

While the U.K. general election is still 4 years off, the same cannot be said for the United States Presidential and Congressional elections. 

As someone who's center-right, leaning Conservative, I fear that this decade could be another decade of the Progressive Left dominating the political and cultural battles while shaping public discourse. 

Many pundits within the Conservative Movement such as Matt Walsh, Jesse Kelly, Steve Deace, Ryan Girdusky, Josh Hammer, etc. are seemingly throwing in the towel, believing that this is the end of both the U.S.A. and Western Civilization. Some have now been suggesting that the U.S. would be better splitting up into multiple countries or outright fleeing it for another one.

69,Predictions for Police Defunding,"There have been some wild speculation about the results of defunding the police, but they all seem to assume there is no subtext, that the liberals are being honest.

To me this goes against everything I know about liberals, so I wanted to make a few predictions and see what you all think of them, and if you have a few predictions that people haven't put forward yet.

Liberals always say one thing when they mean another, so when they say ""defund the police"" what they likely mean could be:

1.  All LE need to be removed from local control and placed under DOJ control.  They've already been trying to do this, Trump has been blamed for pushing back:

https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/criminal-justice/news/2017/04/13/430461/trump-administration-putting-doj-policing-reform-efforts-risk/

2. Local government LE at least in major cities ended, but private corps replace them.  They will find a way to get around those pesky rights that government police have to abide by, and various other shenanigans will be tried to increase the power of government to oppress conservatives while ignoring leftist transgressions.

3.  Police won't disappear, but the decrease in funding will give an excuse to decrease policing of real criminals, and instead focus on ""revenue enhancing enforcement"" in the suburbs.

The end result they are looking for is to decrease policing of Leftist demographics, while increasing the policing on Right wing demographics.",askaconservative,1591923394

1) If these people are so patriotic, why love the flag of the people who betrayed America in the name of slavery?

2) It's a battle flag, not the actual Confederacy flag, which was only used to attack/kill.

3) The Confederacy LOST the war, thus they're flying a flag for the losing team


I personally think this flag should not be protected by free speech for these reasons, just like the SS flag isn't in Germany. Some people who do care about this flag, explain why or at least why others fly it.

EDIT: For those advocating it stands for state rights, I feel the Gadsden Flag is a better and more appropriate symbol of that message that is already widely used. It is still used in the US military and even appears on license plates, while serving as an expression against the tyranny of large governments and the protection of state rights. In contrast, the Confederacy flag in question stands more for slavery since the Civil War was, as directly shown and expressed in history books and excerpts from the time on both sides, a war fought to protect the practice of slavery.",askaconservative,1591913294

Since 1799 western society has been in a free fall, we won’t talk about 60% of the world because they don’t suffer with the issues of the west they might have financial problems but that’s because of socialism and corruption, but they aren’t morally corrupted.

I think 2020 is finally the catalyst year: we’ve seen 60 years of liberalism which accelerated in the 80’s and skyrocketed in the 2000’s it also brought economic liberalism which has:

• Destroyed wages

• Destroyed families ( People naturally want to have families it’s biologically ingrained and they would have to surgically alter people to stop this)

• Crushed low income people.

Liberalism is now in its final stages “Intersectional Anarcho-Tyranny”

Intersectional = Straight white men are responsible for all of our problems.

Anarcho = Without rule.

Tyranny = Authoritarianism.

A small minority is ruling and they are crushing everyone with lofty, airy fairy policies kind of like Reddit; conservatives, rationals, nationalists , non-inter-sectionalists will leave reddit in droves costing them millions and Reddit will become a useless platform devoid of any worthy discussion...they will be destroyed by their own “liberalism”

Nationalists will rise up : Russia: Hungary: Serbia : Poland and other European and western countries will follow suit.

Marxism will come into place to counteract it and the current communist states will bunker down.

(Premise 1) The bible can be interpreted to say that inter-racial marriages are against god.

&gt;The U.S. officially entered a recession in February, marking the end of the 128-month expansion that was the longest in records reaching back to 1854. But this time, the severity and breadth of the coronavirus-induced downturn prompted it to break with past practice, “even if it turns out to be briefer than earlier contractions,” the NBER’s Business Cycle Dating Committee said. Investors are betting on that outcome: The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 461 points on Monday, up 1.7% and just 6.7% shy of its February highs.  
&gt;  
&gt;The probable duration of the recession is a matter of debate among economists and policy makers and is likely to influence discussions on the need for additional economic relief. Congress has already provided $3.3 trillion in emergency spending and tax breaks to support the economy, prompting some worries about a ballooning budget deficit.   
&gt;  
&gt;The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said last week the U.S. economy could take the better part of a decade to fully recover. Gross domestic product will likely be 5.6% smaller in the fourth quarter of 2020 than a year earlier, despite an expected pickup in economic activity in the coming months, and the unemployment rate could still be in double digits by the end of the year, the CBO said.

&gt; Social Darwinism, the theory that human groups and races are subject to the same laws of natural selection as Charles Darwin perceived in plants and animals in nature. According to the theory, which was popular in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the weak were diminished and their cultures delimited while the strong grew in power and cultural influence over the weak. Social Darwinists held that the life of humans in society was a struggle for existence ruled by “survival of the fittest,” a phrase proposed by the British philosopher and scientist Herbert Spencer.
&gt; 
&gt; The theory was used to support laissez-faire capitalism and political conservatism. Class stratification was justified on the basis of “natural” inequalities among individuals, for the control of property was said to be a correlate of superior and inherent moral attributes such as industriousness, temperance, and frugality. Attempts to reform society through state intervention or other means would, therefore, interfere with natural processes; unrestricted competition and defense of the status quo were in accord with biological selection. The poor were the “unfit” and should not be aided; in the struggle for existence, wealth was a sign of success. At the societal level, social Darwinism was used as a philosophical rationalization for imperialist, colonialist, and racist policies, sustaining belief in Anglo-Saxon or Aryan cultural and biological superiority.",askaconservative,1591628076
78,Does human life have any inherent worth?,"I was watching *Hannibal* last night and was impressed by how casually it treats the loss of human life. To the characters in it, people die and it has no importance, since in one moment they are alive and in the next, irrelevant.

This naturally led to idle musings. I think this approach is basically correct; we are microscopic dots on the head of a pin, and when we stop moving, we quickly disappear into the background noise. Nor would it matter if a benevolent god or other people took notice of us, since they never know our inner selves. We are simply inconsequential and our deaths unmemorable.

From this I went on to other thoughts along these veins, namely my usual thought, which is that people are different. Some I would lament if they died; others would be a relief; still others I would have no problem ending (I want a cool ""murder suit"" like Hannibal Lecter, played by Mads Mikkelsen -- pronounced ""mass mick-ALE-zen,"" the actor being an atavism within Nordic stock to a Saami ancestor, sort of like how Famke Janssen has blonde/blue sisters but looks Italian -- uses when he approaches his victims, clear-eyed and silent, to act viciously in a state of total organization, efficiency, and aggression).

&gt; The direct antithesis to the empire was the Commune. The cry of “social republic,” with which the February Revolution was ushered in by the Paris proletariat, did but express a vague aspiration after a republic that was not only to supercede the monarchical form of class rule, but class rule itself. The Commune was the positive form of that republic.  
  
Translation: Let me talk about the awesome Paris Commune!  
    
&gt; Paris, the central seat of the old governmental power, and, at the same time, the social stronghold of the French working class, had risen in arms against the attempt of Thiers and the Rurals to restore and perpetuate that old governmental power bequeathed to them by the empire. Paris could resist only because, in consequence of the siege, it had got rid of the army, and replaced it by a National Guard, the bulk of which consisted of working men. This fact was now to be transformed into an institution. **The first decree of the Commune, therefore, was the suppression of the standing army, and the substitution for it of the armed people.**  
  
Translation: First, we had to replace the government and military law enforcement with armed socialists. 
    
&gt; The Commune was formed of the municipal councillors, chosen by universal suffrage in the various wards of the town, responsible and revocable at short terms. The majority of its members were naturally working men, or acknowledged representatives of the working class. The Commune was to be a working, not a parliamentary body, executive and legislative at the same time.  
  
Translation: The Commune is an ideological mob without any checks or balances.  
    
&gt; Instead of continuing to be the agent of the Central Government, the police was at once stripped of its political attributes, and turned into the responsible, and at all times revocable, agent of the Commune. So were the officials of all other branches of the administration.   
  
Translation: The Commune made the police &amp; government accountable only to leftism and any wrongthink was grounds for instant dismissal. 
  
&gt; From the members of the Commune downwards, the public service had to be done at workman’s wage. The vested interests and the representation allowances of the high dignitaries of state disappeared along with the high dignitaries themselves. Public functions ceased to be the private property of the tools of the Central Government.  
  
Translation: We banned the wealthy and protests. No more wrongthink allowed.   
  
&gt; Not only municipal administration, but the whole initiative hitherto exercised by the state was laid into the hands of the Commune.  
  
Translation: The Commune was a socialist dictatorship. Nothing else was allowed.   
  
&gt; Having once got rid of the standing army and the police – the physical force elements of the old government – the Commune was anxious to break the spiritual force of repression, the “parson-power"", by the disestablishment and disendowment of all churches as proprietary bodies. The priests were sent back to the recesses of private life, there to feed upon the alms of the faithful in imitation of their predecessors, the apostles.  
  
Translation: The second step after taking over the police is to abolish churches.",askaconservative,1591581820

I usually see white people on FaceBook posting their videos and the upvotes consist of roughly 90% white people(a rough sampling, there are often millions). I occasionally see Trump flirting with this type of rhetoric but he and other conservative leaders are more careful when discussing the subject. What do you think about their claim that the democratic party is using them?

Here is a recent video:

[BLM is a Leftist Lie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLuJa9X21PE&amp;t=33s)

It appears they say the things that white conservatives don't often openly say(without backlash), their views are frequently shared on social media by white conservatives/Trump supporters during recent periods of racial/social unrest to show that ""see, these two black guys said it so that validates our feelings, we were right!"" So again, their followers are mostly white, they are black twins using divisive language because, ""well, they can't be racist, they're black, silly!""

It's a very sensitive topic and invokes the old ""Uncle Tom"" racially charged and derogatory epithet. I'm a white person and can't speak for black people but this interests me, I've occasionally watched their videos but it's difficult to enjoy them since I'm clearly not among the target audience. With narrow targeting their message is not one of inclusiveness or unity, they seem goal oriented. I would like to hear a conservative trump supporter's thoughts on this.

So with police shootings there's no bias on behalf of cops. If anything, cops are actually less likely to shoot if you're black.

Mr. Fryer found that blacks were either less likely to be shot or there was no difference between blacks and whites.

Most police bias supposedly occurs with non-lethal force. Even still, the differences don't conform to the picture frequently being painted by the rather grandiose claims being made. For example, it seems a negligible difference for 'use of pepper spray or baton', 'point of weapon', and 'push to ground.'

This data affirms that if there's any 'systemic racism' it certainly isn't characterised by a bunch of cops covertly planning the best ways in which they can murder black people. Rather, it would suggest subtle, most likely subconscious, racial bias. But even then, it's still not obvious to me that these differences can be explained by that sort of racism. Moreover, I don't think this study looked at the ethnicity of policemen who employed non-lethal force. We can probably safely cast aside the notion that black police are being racist against black people.

I would further argue, if police show no bias in lethal force this might actually count as evidence for them not showing any bias in non-lethal force. In other words, if they're not biased in lethal force why would they be biased in non-lethal force? Surely we would expect one to follow from the other.",askaconservative,1591203495

I just read an excellent and informative article about this, and one of the ideas that seemed acceptable to me was for individual neighborhoods/communities to ""adopt"" their homeless population. By that I mean they come up with ways to help that work the best for that area instead of making broad, citywide legislation which may work in one area but not another. It seems like that would just be throwing money out the window. There has also been huge success with organizations that combine housing with social support that gradually wean people off of assistance and into their own lives. Something like 90% of people who get that help go on to keep their apartment and become functioning members of the community, which honestly shocked me.

&gt; Jordan, who has represented Ohio's 4th congressional district since 2007, served as an assistant wrestling coach for Ohio State from 1986 to 1994. And as NBC News' Corky Siemaszko reported Tuesday, a trio of Jordan's former wrestlers have come forward to say ""it was common knowledge that Strauss showered regularly with the students and inappropriately touched them during appointments,"" not to mention that it ""would have been impossible for Jordan to be unaware.""
&gt; 
&gt; Strauss, who died in 2005, was told by former Jordan mentor and Ohio State wrestling head coach Russ Hellickson that he was being ""too hands on"" with students, per Siemazsko. And the three former wrestlers -- Mike DiSabato, Dunyasha Yetts and one who wished to remain anonymous -- said Jordan either knew of Strauss's misconduct from locker-room gossip or direct reports from wrestlers.

37,Do you think LGBT people could be included in the conservative movement?,"As a gay man, I would like to say a few things. I don't have many conservative friends at the moment, but I have to say that I genuinely appreciate conservatives and many of their viewpoints and wish to get to know more. I live in a pretty liberal area and interact with mostly a liberal group of people (college educated people). I understand there are a lot of conservative people out there and I want to get know because I think they bring a unique perspective to the conversation that needs to be heard. Having said that, I have questions.

A lot of liberals, especially within the LGBT community, has a reputation of being very suspicious of the conservative movement. Many think that conservatives want to take away the rights of LGBT people. This is one of the reasons why many LGBT people can be quite hostile to conservatives. I personally don't think most conservatives harbor any ill will against LGBT people. I think their perspective is generally misunderstood by many LGBT people. I also think that there is a great diversity of LGBT people and there a lot of LGBT people, especially gay men, that would open to the conservative agenda. I think we're entering a more nationalistic and conservative period in time and think that we need to have a huge debate as to the role of LGBT people in the conservative movement. I was wondering what do you think of LGBT people? Do you know any? What do you think the role/ position will be in the conservative movement?",askaconservative,1591027821

The divison is a systemic problem with many contributing factors, but Trump's aggressive us-vs-them message is particularly egregious because it comes from the president. This is also a very stressful time where we all could use some kind words instead of more angry ranting - no matter who it's from.

I think it's really easy at this moment to stop seeing each other as people, to judge one another's entire existence by their political affiliation. I know that I find myself guilty of doing this, although I make a conscious effort not to. The truth is that we're all Americans, we all share a similar culture, and we all want what we think is best for the country. I think a lot of people are focusing more on our differences rather than our commonalities. We're watching cities burn due in part to this chasm that has developed between us. None of us want to see more damage done to the country. I'm worn out by all the conflict. May I ask you to take a few moments to take a tiny action directly opposed to rioting - to think about the things we all share?

I love baseball and rock and roll. I think there should be term limits on Congresspeople. I think everyone, of any income, should pay their dang taxes - *all* of them.

So I am asking this of fellow conservatives, because the media seems to be very much against conservatives, what do you think it will take to get back to, or have at all, a fair and balanced news media.  I don’t think that free speech should be censored at all, but at what point are these people shouting fire in a movie theater without there being a fire.  How to you get out of college with a degree in journalism and don’t know how to fact check.  Remember when lying in the news got you fired?

I think freedom of speech is very important, it is one of those hills I am willing to die on, but when I look at the media today it scares me because I can only see it going in two ways. One, the government will have to censor it somehow because of the harm it creates, similar to yelling fire in a theater. Two, they will become more powerful and controlling with their lies.

Firstly I'm not American so I may be lacking some context and I don't know how Stonetoss is generally viewed by conservatives so I apologize if this is a bit on the gaslight-ie side.

What's up with this comic? At first I read this and I thought what is he trying to say? He's criticising peaceful and non peaceful protesting. So what does he want people to do, is their a third kind? What's

Then I see the ""black kills white on opposite day"" subtitle and I say oh right he's saying this is an outlier and their over reacting. I don't know the number so I don't know how true this is but I am aware of the arguments about black on black and black on white violence being more common. I don't totally see how that's relevant here but ok it's an opinion.

But having a horrified reaction here isn't wrong and even if you ignore the wider context (on both sides). This specific action by a police officer is horrifying and to dismiss the communitys anger at this moment as an over reaction is borderline sociopathic. The people in the streets are not above criticism, I mean yeah don't riot. But the response isn't to say your feelings are wrong why are you even mad?

Also how does he ignore the wider context? Kaepernick started the kneeling years ago for this exact reason. So even if you disagree or feel it's an overeacrion it shows that people have felt this way for some time so anger bubbling over is understandable even if unjustifed. 

Also how can you say Kaepernick's ideas are unjustified/silly in a situation that proves him right, or is at least an argument in his favour?

Maybe he's just a troll and I've been russled. Am I'm over thinking this or do conservatives agree with his sentiment?",askaconservative,1590798907

Republicans (pre-Trump and pre-tea party) have been against regulation. 

Since 2016, the current administration has pushed against any regulation of social networks. Arguably because having these platforms unregulated have benefited Republicans more than Democrats. 

With Twitters actions this week, Trump has since threatened regulation. Do you think his change is stance is permanent, and will the party shift to support his opinion?

My opinion:
- I don’t think Twitter flagging Trumps tweets will change anything. It reinforces opinions on both sides. 
- If anything, I think it will rally his supporters with the narrative of “Trump against the world.”
- I think social media companies should be regulated. 
- I’d even say some of them want to be regulated because then any criticism could be brushed off on the government I stead of the platform.

He also seems to regard himself in a very holier than thou-manner by disregarding said questions from the press. All in all, I feel like he cannot take criticism at all. Furthermore, he seems to make promises he can’t uphold, and he tends to use adjectives to make things seem better or worse than they really are.
To me, the US political system seems to be extremely polarizing, and it’s like a sports match - it’s all about winning, and making sure the other team loses. Do you honestly view Trump as a strong leader who knows what he’s doing, as opposed to the babbling, insecure fool I view him as?

Think about it, we essentially went the better part of 3 years with any major racial events and subsequent racial backlash and protests. Now in the matter of week we've had the following:

1) Georgia - White people supposedly kill a Black guy for jogging.  
2) New York - White woman tries to call police on a Black guy who is bird watching.  
3) Minnesota - White cops supposedly kill a Black guy in cold blood.

Does anyone else find it interesting that we got 3 years without stuff like this and now in weeks all of this has happened? And that it's coincidentally happening in an Election Year?

I really don't think so. Part of me believes the virus and all of these incidents are to drive up division between blacks and white. The virus is obviously racist because it kills blacks at a higher percentage than whites and Donald Trump downplayed it because he wanted more blacks to die. Now all these racial incidents driving a divide between blacks and whites in general.

I'm guessing the point is to errode Trump's support among blacks. Blacks have been shown to support Trump more than a traditional Republican. Perhaps even up to 15-20% support among Blacks. If 15-20% of blacks vote for Trump the election is over for the Democrats.

This all seems like a way for Democrats to remind blacks the following:

1) You aren't white and you never will be.  
2) Conservatives will always hate you and look at you as inferior. Only we look at you as people.  
3) Come back to the plantation and vote Democrat. We will protect you against the evil whites.

Words were said he called me a bitch, I said if I was a bitch and was offended by that you would be reprimanded in your world perfect and arrested. A few more things were brought up I was overall winning the argument and then n word was brought up I said either all words are ok or no words are ok. He said it has history, I said yeah most slurs have history behind them but for some reason this word (the n word) is worse and should never be said unless you’re black, Hispanic, white looking but have the slightest amount of Black in you, or basically anything other than white.

I respect their political beliefs and they respect mine, largely because we both grew into something new: they were born into liberal households and were capable of finding that they better align with conservative beliefs despite that. I am the opposite, I grew up in a conservative household but found liberalism to speak to me more. 
So I ask: have you once been liberal and when/how did your transition into conservatism occur? Do you trust people who have made an ‘active’ political switch any more or less than those who align with the beliefs they were born into? Do you think it’s at all “important for young people to be liberal”?

Please be nice, I’m just very curious. I find many of my young liberal friends are fairly intolerant of hearing the voices of those on the other side of the political binary.

I think right now the cure (lockdowns) is getting worse than the virus.

I wear a mask to the grocery store, but not to walk outside. I don't really care if you wear a mask or not, just don't cough on the potatoes.

I have been to a sit down restaurant to eat within the last 2 weeks. The tables were thinned out for distancing and the staff was wearing masks and gloves. It was awkward, but encouraging.

I am a little sad that some in the government have taken this as a sign that they can usurp the Constitution (particularly the First Amendment). 

I am optimistic about economic recovery, if we do it the right way and let the market heal itself.

I am big sad about all the people who have lost their jobs and are struggling to feed their family. I have donated heavily to the local food bank here even though I had a 20% payout and have asked people that I know that are still employed to try to find it in their hearts to do so.

I find the vision of society that the author describes quite appealing. However, I am already quite inclined to that way of thought and want to hear other arguments/visions based on a different approach.

So I was wondering if anyone had recommendations for books, research, articles, or even podcasts and videos that refute the tenets of the Nordic model (a sort of free-market welfare state, I guess you could call it), and instead lays out a vision for America based on a more traditionally conservative perspective.

I'm sure many people, myself included, would love to see a democratic China, but that dream seems to have been dashed ever since 1989. China is much too big and powerful to take down through military might alone, so the only solution that I see as somewhat feasible would be to weaken them economically.

98,Why aren't conservatives more concerned about paying for the uninsured and those unable to pay for healthcare while getting ripped off at the same time?,"When someone walks into the ER etc, by law they must be treated if they have a serious enough ailment.  If your insurance doesn't cover something, you get the bill afterwards.  From these situations and others like it, often people are unable to pay their medical bills.  Part of the reason healthcare costs are so high is to cover the hospital's costs for people that are ultimately unable to pay.  Much of this money is never paid (hence the high rate of bankruptcy).  Like any business, you have to cover your losses.  This raises the prices of everything across the board for everyone.

This means that people who have insurance and pay their medical bills are footing the bills for those who can not pay.  This is basically a form of universal healthcare where we wait until it is bad enough to treat in the ER.  Waiting for things to get that bad often costs much more to treat than preventative care would have costed - inflating the costs to the rest of us even more. 

While it's not perfect, medicare and medicaid work for many people.  Paying for insurance through taxes would mean that it is taken out with each paycheck and no one paying their taxes can freeload healthcare.  

According to the [WHO, the US is number one in only one category for healthcare; cost.   In all other metrics the US is between rank 15 and 72](https://www.who.int/whr/2000/en/whr00_en.pdf).

5,I’m so unclear unclear on the virus and how it is being dealt with and so is my dad- we hear totally different information!,"My dad and I have been having trouble talking about the virus lately and I want to understand where he is coming from. My many of friends are pretty liberal/ I see myself as pretty moderate (of course I don’t really line up perfectly with any specific ideology- like I am not  a fan of over the top anti gun regulations but at the same time I’m pro strong regulations on other certain stuff), but to sum it up- my dad is conservative and I’m not on the same page as him in many ways. 


I discovered that my dad and I have been hearing opposite information about the virus, how it is being handled, how serious it is, how political it is, etc. but he’s not great at explaining what he has heard or remembering where he heard it. All I know is that he didn’t just make up what he said. That’s just not something he does/ cares to do/ has interest in doing. He’s busy being an engineer usually. 

The only problem is that when I search the internet for what he says, I get pretty different results than when he does which is kinda weird. Like we can’t even agree on facts because we aren’t even hearing/ reading the same things (not even through fault of our own it feels like because I’m really trying!!). 

I try to follow all political perspectives because my grandpa taught me that is really really important and showed me that he’d subscribe to liberal, moderate, and conservative magazines for his news. I admire him a lot and I aspire to be like him and really hear people out, so follow conservative, liberal, and centrist Reddit’s and such. Pro women and pro men sub-Reddit’s. Pro-life and pro-choice. Pro gun and anti gun. Socialism and capitalism subreddits. Etcetera. Any topic I can think of to do that for. 

So, I really want to understand my dad and what he is saying better because I love him, but it has been challenging since he is a math guy rather than a talking/ debating guy. I want to stop feeling like we have to butt heads since we disagree on these sort of things. I thought it was just that we disagree but really we don’t even get the same information and news! 

Plus on top of that political stuff is the only topic we really both have in common to talk about at the moment. He doesn’t really like to talk to me about fixing his car or building cabinets and that kind of stuff, so this is important to me.

She is also my buddies Mom and I cannot get into with her for risk of it becoming an argument. I just nod politely. 


She was telling us that things in NY are being exaggerated and the she is old school and she just wants build up an immunity. 

This is contrary to what I am hearing from the CDC, John Hopkins and other medical professionals. 

Also for context I get my news primarily from AP, NPR, The Atlantic, Vox, NYT and WSJ. I do not watch cable news. 

Further, my MIL is a nurse on Long Island. She said that her hospital was overwhelmed by the numbers and that the system can not withstand a herd immunity approach. Finally, have seen stories of areas of NYC where the morgues are filled and they are literally brining in refrigerated trailers to store the bodies. 

My neighbor is only the most recent person to tell me this is overblown. All of my friends that have expressed this are very conservative.

9,"If America rejects Trumpism in November, will conservatives reject democracy?","&gt;Whatever Trump’s personal fate, his Republican Party seems headed for electoral trouble... As the next presidential race nears, it will become ever more imperative to rally around Trump. The more isolated Trump becomes within the American political system as a whole, the more he will dominate whatever remains of the conservative portion of that system. He will devour his party from within.

This is from a January 2018 article by George W. Bush speechwriter David Frum. The election he references is, of course, the upcoming one. And his prediction that Trump would become “more isolated” and “devour his party from within” has, of course, proven accurate. He continues from there:

&gt;Maybe you do not much care about the future of the Republican Party. You should. Conservatives will always be with us. If conservatives become convinced that they cannot win democratically, they will not abandon conservatism. They will reject democracy. The stability of American society depends on conservatives’ ability to find a way forward from the Trump dead end, toward a conservatism that cannot only win elections but also govern responsibly.

Is he right? (It’s not the “conservatism” part I’m interested in so much as the “democracy” part. When Trump goes down in flames, and history commemorates him as the sub-Nixonian, wannabe-dictator thug he very much openly is, will Trump supporters become *conservatives* again? Will they join the remaining 65% of Americans at the table of democracy? Or will they flip the table over, burn it to the ground, and pee on everybody?)

This is by no means a nuanced argument, just a hypothetical with random numbers, but wouldn’t it make more sense that 10 people have the ability to earn 100 million dollars a year than one individual earning the whole billion? Or even five people making 200 million? In my head, it seems like entrepreneurship at this scale is stifled by the guy/business who has essentially monopolized the market. 

Important to note that I’m not saying the cap should be a billion, I don’t know exactly what the limit should be, and there are probably a myriad of arguments to be had about the method of said cap itself.

87,Are you familiar with writers from the Frankfurt school?,"Herbert Marcuse had something interesting things to say about the revolutionary movement:

&gt; The very mechanism that ties the individual to his society has changed and social control is anchored in the new needs which it has produced. Most important of all, the pressure of consumerism has led to the total integration of the working class into the capitalist system. Its political parties and trade unions have become thoroughly bureaucratized and the power of negative thinking or critical reflection has rapidly declined.[31] The working class is no longer a potentially subversive force capable of bringing about revolutionary change. As a result, rather than looking to the workers as the revolutionary vanguard, Marcuse put his faith in an alliance between radical intellectuals and those groups not yet integrated into one-dimensional society, the socially marginalized, the substratum of the outcasts and outsiders, the exploited and persecuted of other ethnicities and other colors, the unemployed and the unemployable. These were the people whose standards of living demanded the ending of intolerable conditions and institutions and whose resistance to one-dimensional society would not be diverted by the system. Their opposition was revolutionary even if their consciousness was not.[30]

Also; 
&gt; 
&gt; According to Buchanan, Theodor Adorno, Max Horkheimer, Herbert Marcuse, and Eric Fromm were all German social
&gt; radicals who rebuilt Marxism from an economic doctrine into a
&gt; morally subversive force.15 Buchanan focuses on The Authoritarian Personality, a collection of critical essays edited by Adorno
&gt; and Horkheimer that came out in 1950. In this ponderous indictment of “bourgeois Christian” society, traditional bourgeois values
&gt; are made to seem “pathological” and “pre-fascist.” Through its
&gt; “critical theory” applied to the established culture, the Frankfurt
&gt; School, which moved to the United States from Germany in the
&gt; 1930s, laid the base for its reconstructed Marxist revolution. In
&gt; this new formulation, socialists would be concerned less with economic exploitation than with vicious prejudice and its seemingly
&gt; respectable bearers. Unless removed from power, the dominant
&gt; class would go on engendering racial hatred, anti-Semitism, misogyny, and homophobia. Cataclysmic change was essential to get
&gt; rid of bourgeois society, which the Frankfurt School maintained
&gt; was a source of social pathology.",askaconservative,1589638181
88,Do Americans idealize doing what is right more than being free?,"In a recent [editorial in the *American Sun*](https://theamericansun.com/2020/05/12/the-hard-core-of-the-new-right/), the classic American archetype seems to be someone who works against freedom and the System to do what is right:

&gt; The quintessential American myth is a lone man with a gun who cannot trust on a higher authority but knows what is right whether pioneer, cowboy or Dirty Harry. Boys who grew up in the 80s looked up to the heroic characters played by Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone, characters who exemplified bravery and strength, not least of all through their bodybuilder physiques. Both action stars played heroes who would have to go outside the broken legal system to protect women whether family or love interests. 

In other words, these guys are not from the self-centered individualistic, narcissistic, or solipsistic world that the ""I drive an SUV because I can, eat steak for breakfast, and engage in risky sex because I have freedom and this is what I *want*, and screw everyone and everything else.""

Virtually everyone else was in on it, even the supposedly independent or contraraian thinkers like molyneux, Fuentes, Vincent James, they were all fear mongering, saying this was the new Spanish Flu, that we all needed to buy bunkers. 

You look at their sponsors and nearly all of them shill out survival gear. They made money off of this, and played into the left's hands. Result, economy tanked. Bernie Sanders programs passed with Republican blessings. Old Joe has a .5 percent chance of winning instead of zero. 

I don't even really see a left or a right anymore. Republicans talk about how bad pelosi is for funding pot stores, but they let her and the left have everything. They can easily sue and stop these shutdowns, reopen they economy, but they don't, because they agree with them, knowing the virus is 99.99 percent non lethal, knowing kids can't spread it, knowing that 20x the population has it asymptomatically, knowing herd immunity is the superior solution.

But some context, an excerpt from the article I'm referencing:

&gt; In redefining what “present” means in the 21st century, Democrats who control the chamber have stressed that they are simply trying to find a way for the House — a coequal branch of government and, they argue, a crucial counterweight to President Trump — to perform its basic functions at a time when the coronavirus has made congregating in Washington a dire health risk. They promise the changes will only be temporary, point to similar moves by legislatures around the world including British Parliament, and insist that the alternative is a House that cannot function as intended.

&gt; “It is in keeping with the vitality of the House that we are doing this, not in opposition to the traditions of the House,” Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California said before the vote.

&gt; But in going forward so quickly with so major a change, Democrats are nevertheless plunging the House into a constitutional and institutional unknown.

&gt; Republicans, almost reflexively, are opposed to the changes and have denounced them as an unconstitutional power grab by Democrats who control the chamber.

&gt; But beyond the partisan considerations, a broad cross-section of congressional scholars, parliamentary experts and former officials warn that the decision could have unintended and long-lasting consequences, altering the course of the body in fundamental ways that few rules changes in the last two centuries have.

If you are against a minimum wage are you against unions. In addition what role does government have to play. If government isn’t supposed to be involved then why are there child labor laws.

&gt; It is not conspiracy-mongering to note that the investigation into Trump was predicated on an opposition-research document filled with fabulism and, most likely, Russian disinformation. We know the DOJ withheld contradictory evidence when it began spying on those in Trump’s orbit. We have proof that many of the relevant FISA-warrant applications — almost every one of them, actually — were based on “fabricated” evidence or riddled with errors. We know that members of the Obama administration, who had no genuine role in counterintelligence operations, repeatedly unmasked Trump’s allies. And we now know that, despite a dearth of evidence, the FBI railroaded Michael Flynn into a guilty plea so it could keep the investigation going.
&gt; 
&gt; What’s more, the larger context only makes all of these facts more damning. By 2016, the Obama administration’s intelligence community had normalized domestic spying. Obama’s director of national intelligence, James Clapper, famously lied about snooping on American citizens to Congress. His CIA director, John Brennan, oversaw an agency that felt comfortable spying on the Senate, with at least five of his underlings breaking into congressional computer files. His attorney general, Eric Holder, invoked the Espionage Act to spy on a Fox News journalist, shopping his case to three judges until he found one who let him name the reporter as a co-conspirator. The Obama administration also spied on Associated Press reporters, which the news organization called a “massive and unprecedented intrusion.”",askaconservative,1589379306

That's a completely separate discussion we have all seen a million times and there's no point re-hashing it here.  I don't want to hear about researchers or studies or anything like that.  My questions are purely about \*reaction\* - I'm trying to determine the \*motive\* behind people who think human-caused climate change is not happening.

1. If human-caused climate change IS happening, then it seems like a no-brainer to do something about it.  If climate change is NOT happening, then what is the harm in doing the things that are suggested to deal with it?  Even if it all turned out to be a hoax, as some people feel, what would it hurt to move towards renewable energy of various kinds, to have less pollution, less garbage, preserve non-renewable resources, and so on?  Why do you feel so strongly about this?  Exactly what do you feel would be bad about those steps?  They worst thing that could possible happen is that we end up with a cleaner, more energy-efficient world.  So what do you feel is the downside?
2. If it were all a hoax - if people were actually making up data, as some people claim.... why?  What's the incentive to pretend that the climate is changing?  Who would gain, and in what way?  The answer to the question in the opposite direction (""Who gains from denying climate change?"") has an awful lot of excellent answers.  But who would gain, and in what way, by inventing climate change?  Why would anyone invent such a thing?  For what purpose?
3. How do you feel your day-to-day life would be negatively affected by the proposed changes such as renewable energy and less pollution?  Is there something in your everyday life that you fear would change for the negative?  What do you fear might happen?

I am looking for your recommendations on news sources - can be a newspaper, blog, radio, tv (as long as I can access it via web) - for all things conservative in Latin America. I speak Spanish and Portuguese, so language is not an issue. I would prefer first-hand sources from the different countries themselves rather than summaries or second-hand reporting. The big media outlets tend to lean more or less heavily to the left in these countries, so smaller outlets or individual bloggers with a good track record are welcome as well. Looking forward to your recommendations, thank you!",askaconservative,1589218714
3,I'm trying to understand the shift in Politics being greater than Conservative Morals on a local-level. Why are politics &gt; morals? Example in post.,"I've been struggling with this one for a while now and it appears that at every corner, there's yet again, another example of politics over conservative morals being made. From National to local it's no longer a wonder if it's happening but now a 'why is it happening and do other Conservatives see it?' 

Case in point: In our state of Oregon there's a salon owner who is opening up her salon despite orders to remain closed (copying the lady in Texas). The issue of her opening or not is another issue that I'll avoid here. What is the issue is what is public knowledge about this woman and her husband now who is backing her and doing so in very public ways (rallies, social media, GoFundMe, etc). 

She and her husband are, all publicly known: swingers, bisexuals, botox riddled, tattoos head-to-toe, vain (her posts and comments leave nothing to the imagination), and greedy (by her actions and furthered by her history). Also, they haven't stepped foot in a Church for twenty plus years outside of weddings and funerals. Those who know her or have followed her, will not have any arguments on who and what she represents. In fact, in the discussions I've had on this with others, these are the things we all firmly agree on. 

Take any of those and while the argument that most of those are not my business, she is a ""public figure"" - she calls herself a public figure, she's set up a Facebook page as a public figure where she calls herself a public figure, and she's embraced being called a public figure in the media (talk shows, radio programs, TV interviews, and in print). 

She is, by every measure, anti-Conservative in her actions and values. There's a lot to this story and while true her claim is to ""feed her family"", we know that's not true based on her legal fees, GoFundMe, repercussions from business lost, her other businesses, and loss of lease on this business. It's a political move by her to gain fame, that's it. 

She has called on ""Patriot Prayer"", ""Proud Boys"" (Joey Gibson made an appearance at her rally last week), and various Conservative outlets (news, churches, social media) for support. What is alarming is that she's actually been getting their support, from all of them. And very publicly. This is all pretty shocking to those of us who follow Conservative values. Nationally it was shocking but now we are seeing it down to the very micro scale in our own backyards. And it's all from one small subset of support: Conservatives. Not necessarily republicans, libertarians, liberals, or others, but very specifically Conservatives.

I know that there are going to be ""bad"" conservatives but so far, we haven't seen any conservatives actually take a stand and call her out. Again, all publicly known that she's a swinger, she and her husband are both bisexual, she's bloated in the face with botox, she's tattooed from head-to-toe, by her actions throughout, she's proven to be vain and greedy. And, neither of them have stepped foot in a Church for at least 20 years other than weddings and funerals.   

There is a lot to her story here and I am paraphrasing much of it but the jest remains the same. An anti-Conservative being placed on a pedestal by Conservatives for nothing more than political points and fame. Conservatives that are all too giddy to forget their morals and place the Anti-Conservative on a pedestal for politics. Is this the new normal?

15. most Asians governments are influenced by legalistic and Confucianism values
16. Confucianism values include Shared rituals are an effective tool to promote mutual understanding. Learning is lifelong with the goal being to become virtuous and it must be approached with joy. Learning must build on what we already know. Assimilate what is good in others and re-examine oneself for faults. Family is the fundamental social unit and any moral learning and practice must start from there or must be related to how we behave with our family. Reformation through moral and value education is superior to reformation through the threat of punishment. Social harmony is achieved by each one performing their duties with faithfulness.
17. The Legalists believed that political institutions should be modelled in response to the realities of human behaviour and that human beings are inherently selfish and short-sighted. Thus social harmony cannot be assured through the recognition by the people of the virtue of their ruler, but only through strong state control and absolute obedience to authority. The Legalists advocated government by a system of laws that rigidly prescribed punishments and rewards for specific behaviours. They stressed the direction of all human activity toward the goal of increasing the power of the ruler and the state.",askaconservative,1589177467

I support gun ownership. I think abortion is appropriate when the mother’s health is at risk, and in cases of rape. I don’t see the point of indiscriminately “choosing “ to kill a child because you could not make choices as an adult.

I’m no fan of the identity politics of the left and the holier than thou attitude . I have found that many times Democrats expect you to subscribe to the entire agenda and there is no wiggle room for debate. I’m passionate about policies like healthcare ,unions , drug legalization , and polices that uplift working class America. I believe in the importance of family values , stable 2 parent households ,religion, etc

That aside I’m trying to step outside my liberal bubble and read up on conservative theory. My exposure to conservatives has been as disappointing as my exposure to liberals. All I see from conservatives is whining about how they don’t get enough airtime or how they want to stick it to the libturds. Most of your content and your talking points are reactionary.

As a college student I went to  “young Americans for freedom” events. I genuinely wanted to learn about conservative policy and see if that was a better solution to the problems in America. Instead all I got were appearances from various provocateurs who ranted for a couple hours about how liberals were destroying America. They rehashed the same talking points and fed off the liberal students that came to protest . I didn’t support the liberal  protestors, as college should be a safe space to engage all ideas, but the presenters were disappointing.

 The presenters never gave me something to think about or made a strong case for conservative policies like small government. They just sounded whiny ...

So my question is .. what do you guys stand for ? What books by smart conservatives should I read ?
  
As Reddit conservatives what principles do you have ? How does religion affect your political thought ? I appreciate how conservatism believes in moral truths and refutes the moral relativism of the left ..

Some (I think) refer to culture as a combination of religion and ethnicity. **Sentiment 1** expresses the idea that combining different races and/or ethnicities in a single society will yield a failed society. It will break apart into different societies. 

I understand culture to be ""social customs."" Things done socially. Some cultures carry ideologies (religious or otherwise) that recommend particular social practices. In that sense, *some* cultures are inextricable from ideologies. Most cultures developed regionally. In that sense, *some* cultures are inextricable from ethnicities.

47,What kind of conservative am I?,"Hello. I saw a post from someone else regarding this question earlier, so I'm just curious about what kind of conservative I am now. I used to think people fit neatly into a liberal or a conservative camp - but it's recently dawned on me that conservatism is a multi-faceted political ideology. That being said, here are my opinions regarding the hot button issues of modernity. I haven't listed all the major political points of contention simply because either I'm not knowledgeable enough in those topics to have an actual opinion on them or I just forgot about them. (TL;DR at the bottom)

&amp;#x200B;

* Abortion - I used to be fairly pro-choice, but I posted here recently and discovered that the pro-life faction has something that the pro-choice side doesn't - an argument. Personally, I am against abortion, and I hope that certain groups will discourage abortion and encourage adoption or birth control instead. However, on a legal level, I don't think it's my prerogative to limit what another person can or cannot do, even though I am deeply repulsed by abortion on a moral level.
* Gay Marriage - if two people love each other, who am I to judge? My only problem with it is how radicalized the movement has gotten. [https://thefederalist.com/2019/10/09/how-illinois-schools-teach-preschoolers-to-celebrate-transgenderism/](https://thefederalist.com/2019/10/09/how-illinois-schools-teach-preschoolers-to-celebrate-transgenderism/)
* Religious Freedom - I believe that all people have the right to believe in whatever they want, as long as their religious practices don't infringe on my basic rights. I'm still facing a bit of a conundrum on this part - especially in the Masterpiece Bakery case. In that case, whose rights win? The baker's freedom of religion or the gay couple's protection against discrimination in public accommodations?
* 2A - we have a mental health problem in this country. Not a gun problem. The problem with any sort of further restrictions on guns quickly becomes a slippery slope, especially with how poorly terms like ""semi-automatic"" are defined; the easiest thing to do is to state that these rights ""shall not be infringed"" like it is under the Constitution.
* Freedom of Speech - like with my argument regarding gun rights, any restrictions on freedom of speech quickly become a slippery slope. I may not agree with what you're saying (especially with regards to hate speech), but I cannot implore the government to shut you down for it. In fact, this is one of the things that makes the US objectively better than certain other democratic nations - because our freedom of speech ""shall not be infringed"" by the government under the Constitution.
* Climate Change - I think climate change definitely is occurring, but the extent to which humans are exacerbating it is debatable. I think everyone has a role to play in terms of environmental stewardship, like recycling, not wasting water, turning off lights, etc. Climate change is a problem, but allowing the private sector to reign in green innovation is ultimately going to be better than the Green New Deal. 
* Government regulation of industry - the government should meddle with the free market to stimulate the free market and nothing more. For me this means antitrust laws to break apart monopolies to promote competition. 
* Socialism/Big Government - No. When the government fully controls an aspect of the economy, everything generally goes sideways. I am against anything Big Government. Like I said earlier, government should be large enough to protect our fundamental liberties and promote capitalist innovation and nothing more. I stand by the principle that some conservatives hold - a government large enough to give you these things is also large enough to take them away.
* Immigration - legal immigration of people who want to come to this country and live the American dream should be encouraged - these are people who will eventually give back to society because they intend to come here for a better life. On the other hand, illegal immigration needs to stop. We have no means of documenting them, which debunks every argument that ""tHeY aLsO pAy tAxEs"". I'm not for closed borders (in normal times), nor am I for open borders. I just hope that our borders can be enforced.
* Student Loans - if you're in debt, I'm sorry to say but I'm not giving my money to you to compensate for your poor choices. I might be a bit privileged to say this, as someone about to go to college without any concerns regarding financial problems. However I can assure you that even if I were to take out a loan covering my full tuition, my field of study (and my work ethic) will guarantee me a career lucrative enough so that I won't have to burden anyone else with my debts.
* Space Exploration - absolutely. This is the final frontier, and space is full of new opportunities for the human race to technologically advance itself.

TL;DR: abortion - personally pro-life, legally idk; gay marriage - pro, but I don't like how radicalized it is; religious freedom - pro religion, mostly; climate change - problem but the left's solutions don't work; government regulation - only enough to promote capitalism; socialism - no; immigration - yes legal, no illegal; student loans - I'm not paying for your mistakes; space ex - yes!

50,A few questions for all conservatives,"First, I do want to say that I realize there are a lot of different kinds of conservatives, but sometimes it feels that some types are mutually exclusive with others.

Some background on me. I’m from a very liberal part of a purple state. All my friends are really progressive, and the more political they’ve gotten, the more I realize I’m conservative. Recently I started reading about conservatism on Reddit, and I’m pretty shocked by some of the things people have said. Reading some opinions here, I’m second guessing whether I’m really conservative. I do want to say, I’m asking these questions for personal education, not to start any arguments. Please keep that in consideration.

So, I have a few questions to ask people, and for each, there are follow up questions. 

1. Do you think the US constitution is the greatest set of governing laws ever written?

1a. If you do, what are your thoughts on amendments.

1b. If you think the original version was the best, how do you feel about only white men who owned property being allowed to vote? 

2. What are your thoughts on public education?

2a. If you’re against it, do you think it’s up to the parents to educate their children?

2b. If you think it’s up to the parents to educate, and they were unable because they didn’t have the time or ability, would you be okay if a large segment of the population was uneducated and illiterate? 

3. Do you think the US should be a white ethno-state?

3a. If you do, who gets to stay and who gets to go? (I’m Italian, so I’m white, but I’ve read people on here say Italians aren’t white, and should be sent back to Italy.)

3b. Wouldn’t forcibly exiling American citizens be considered tyranny? Would it not be the right of those expelled to exercise their 2A right and fight back?

4. Do you think women should be allowed to vote? Why or why not.

5. What are your thoughts on same-sex marriage? 

6. Should homosexuality be illegal?

6a. If so, how would that be constitutional?

6b. How would police investigate people’s sexuality without violating their constitutional right?

7. What are your thoughts on drugs and drug legalization? 

7a. What are your thoughts on cannabis consumption in states that have legalized it?

8. What are your thoughts on the US as a Christian nation? 

8a. Should other religions be limited in any way?

9. Those conservatives who believe strongly in individual liberty and personal responsibility: do you find your views mutually exclusive with the socially conservative that want strict laws governing how people have to live?

There are more, but I think these are my main questions. I’m not trying to start any arguments, I’m just trying to understand the different opinions of the conservatives on Reddit.",askaconservative,1588976884

And then you look at statistics of how immigrants vote they almost always vote left regardless of how they got here or where they came from. So isn't supporting any immigration into this country just directly hurting our party ? It's literally shooting ourselves in the foot. 

The only benefit that it has is economic growth. But why do we need a large growing economy ? It's not benefiting us the people. It's only benefiting elitists.

61,Single issue and tribal voting,"As an outsider (UK, Jewish but not practising for full disclosure), I wanted to share my thoughts. We get a huge amount of news from the US over here, and sometimes your president gets more news minutes on the telly than our own government! But I think I have noticed a pattern in the way that Republican congress(wo)men pander to religious conservatives in particular.

I don't mean to intrude or say you're doing it wrong, or anything like that. I'm trying to point out some observations but I have ASD and Asperger's so I struggle with social stuff. I sometimes say things bluntly but no offence is intended.

That out of the way, I'll get to the point.

Have you noticed that abortion is still legal? Even after many years of full GOP control of government over the last few decades? There is a reason for that, and it is not Roe vs Wade.

It will remain legal. It is a scheme to get people to vote against their economic interests.

A lot of people in red states are poor and struggling. Trump promised to fix that, but in the end his tax cuts have disproportionately benefited big business, and a lot of his promises on the campaign trail have been forgotten about.

Religious conservatives often see abortion as THE moral issue of our time, more important than any other political matter. If abortion is ever criminalised, the GOP will no longer have that leverage.

The way I see it is that Republican politicians pander to the pro-life crowd with no intention of actually outlawing abortion. By doing that, they convince single issue voters to vote against their own interests in many other areas. Conservative fiscal policy disproportionately benefits the rich, and the poor get poorer.

Look at other policy areas such as healthcare. The US has the most expensive healthcare system in the world, and the only non-universal system in the developed world. The way things are now, with out-of-network charges and other problems, a short hospital stay can completely bankrupt a family.

I'm not going to go on, as I don't know enough about the American situation, but I genuinely think the abortion issue is being leveraged to get people to vote themselves into more poverty. There are even contradictions there, such as the fact that conservatives lobby against the very things that reduce abortion numbers such as scientifically-accurate sex education and access to contraception. (I'm not getting into the contraception vs abortifacient issue but some conservatives oppose all contraception.) And at the end of the day, abortion will still be legal.

Of course, very few are what I would call full conservative, or traditionalist in the ""1788"" sense:

* Monarchism/aristocracy
* Caste system
* Strong national culture including religion

&gt; My refutation of Facebook's ridiculous rationale for banning us.
&gt;
&gt; Dear Facebook,
&gt; 
&gt; I write in response to your 1) disabling of the VDARE.com account 2) making a public statement about VDARE.com’s practices and intentions vis a vis our account’s termination. 
&gt; 
&gt; Because it informs the termination of our account, I will start with the second issue first. We did not have more than one account. The single account we had was not fake. It was completely traceable as evidenced by users’ ability to make a tax-deductible donation from Facebook, through Network For Good, to the VDARE.com bank accounts. We do not pedal conspiracy. We do not interfere with elections, whatever that means, and have consistently and meticulously honored our limitations as a 501c3. 
&gt; 
&gt; Regarding the termination of our account, we are completely baffled. We were, of course, dismayed to discover the termination and have awaited explanation for three long days. You gave us no warning. We have to date not received any communications at all regarding any strikes, decisions or justifications for this unwarranted termination. The first we hear is from a public statement defaming our business and implicating us in some wild scheme of which we had no part. 
&gt; 
&gt; Further, if your rationale for terminating VDARE.com’s account is to be taken at face value, that is, that we have been terminated as a result of our alleged practices on Facebook, why are our readers being muzzled also? It is currently impossible for anyone to post links to VDARE.com articles on Facebook, no matter who is posting them. Our readers and donors are distressed about this and have written to us for an explanation. Why would our alleged infractions impact their Facebook privileges? 
&gt; 
&gt; Finally, it is my understanding that users own the data they choose to post to Facebook. You are currently holding ours hostage. If you will not reinstate VDARE.com’s page, please return all data immediately and refund us the money we spent advertising.

I personally am more along the lines of American cultural nationalism of the kind Huntington espouses, as I find civic nationalism holds too much of a Tabula Rasa view for cultures, and ethnic nationalism finds everything usually plays into a “blood/racial metaphysic”. I’m an immigration restrictionist and more of a protectionist, though not an isolationist and more favorable of a proper free market, and I find we need to instill cultural and legal practices that preserve American culture while allowing for a proper throughway for assimilation for new citizens who are willing to STAY in a legal matter in a prudential yet effective manner, that focuses on assimilation and proper partaking in American culture.

Despite New York and New Jersey only accounting for about 8.6% of the US population,  they account for 48% of coronavirus fatalities. 

This is why a regional response to re-opening is necessary.  The rest of the country is doing MUCH better.  Common- sense strategies can easily be implemented to protect the at- risk demographic,  while letting people feed their families and helping to ensure that the supply chain doesn't break down. 

With only 34,167 deaths, the death rate for the rest of the US has been 0.01% since this whole thing started.  Considering the overwhelming majority of those deaths are over age 65, the strategy almost presents itself. 

I'm fortunate in that I live in Texas and Gov. Abbott has handled this reasonably well as the state stay at home has expired.  Some local judges have made extended County lockdowns, though,  which is EXACTLY how it should be handled in my mind (although I disagree with the extension).

Years ago I chanced to watch some daytime talk show, might have been Jerry Springer. I don't remember the topic, and I don't remember what the yelling fit of the day was about, and I don't think I ever watched the show again. 

But at some point the host said to one of the yellers, ""Hey, can you just shut up for a minute?""

The guy he said this to was a tall rangy hillbilly, and the hillbilly stopped in his tracks, and said evenly, ""By God, you can't tell ME to shut up."" This memorable conversation followed: 

Host: Why not?

Hillbilly: Because of the first amendment!

Host: Do you even know what the first amendment says?

Hillbilly: Yeah...(long pause)...It says you can't tell me to shut up!

Now, that might seem like not the strongest reason to find hope for the future of the republic. And I wonder if there is hope. But If there is, I think a lot of it is because of guys like this, who have it in their blood and their tradition, that by God you can't tell them to shut up, or not brew their own whiskey, or now, shelter in place. And you ain't getting their guns, either. 

I doubt this guy could quote you what the 1A says. But I think he understands it a lot better than my Ivy-League-educated neighbors, who see the Constitution only as an obstacle to their wonderful progressive program, and think there should be hate speech laws.

Hell, go outside, go protest, don’t follow social distancing, whatever. risk jail time for your protests like every other leader of a movement - since you’re so dedicated to this. but don’t come and spread it to people who are doing their best to follow these guidelines, at least have respect for those around you. but the reason governments have been forced to enforce stay at home orders is because people were NOT following the voluntary ones. personally i think those spreading covid should be open to charges of reckless endangerment, or even manslaughter if it kills who they spread it to. so many of my friends families have risked their lives trying to save ours, either distancing themselves from or ending up infecting their own families, and ill be damned if i wouldn’t respect their work and sacrifice. my family themselves are in a place of financial insecurity, and dealing with a court case that might set us back tens of thousands of dollars. we have no income coming in. yet, we follow the guidelines. i’m saying if we can do that, not that you must, but i pray y’all can keep an open mind out of respect to your friends, family, neighbors, and everyone else around you to try to minimize your contact with them, even if you go out to protest. you reserve that right but i beg of you, please, please, try your best to reduce your exposure to others. i’m sorry for writing so much but i’ve been having a lot of time to think about this, and i needed to say it. thank you.",askaconservative,1588420761

Whilst i dont agree with many of the conclusions people on here come to, the tone and delivery of your convictions is impressively calm and open. Its a good way to present ideas more appealingly to those who might not already hold them, so thankyou for that. 

Sadly though i find that both in British and US political debate people nowadays are seemingly more polarized than i have known before. People are increasingly not able to recognize that a good person may hold a bad idea. Rather the person must be a bad person. 

And soon, both extremes of opinion calcify into their positions, dehumanising and generalizing the opposition more and more. 

I would put forward that this is toxic for the functioning of our western societies. Without something truly shocking occurring such as purges/ civil wars, we are surely destined to have our fates entwined with the countrymen we have so demonised.

Schiavo's husband argued that she would not have wanted prolonged artificial life support without the prospect of recovery, and elected to remove her feeding tube. Her parents disputed her husband's assertions, arguing in favor of continuing artificial nutrition and hydration. The highly publicized and prolonged series of legal challenges caused a seven-year delay before Schiavo's feeding tube was ultimately removed.

&gt; **Assisted suicide**, also known as assisted dying, is suicide undertaken with the aid of another person. The term usually refers to physician-assisted suicide, which is suicide that is assisted by a physician or other healthcare provider. Once it is determined that the person's situation qualifies under the physician-assisted suicide laws for that place, the physician's assistance is usually limited to writing a prescription for a lethal dose of drugs. _Assisted suicide_ **specifically** means suicide in a controlled, professional environment, at the express wish of the patient — not simply helping someone kill themselves.

I think these are similar in that they both concern bringing about a peaceful death for someone who would otherwise most likely live in great pain, suffering, or as a ""shell"" for the rest of their lives.

I agree that after that time it should only be allowed in special cases such as the woman maybe dying if she will carry out the child etc. But lets talk about the time before the 12 week mark. Why should a woman not be able to decide? Im asking this because to be honest I really just dont understand the viewpoint of prolifers but I am trying to understand it to get a better idea. At 12 Weeks the Fetus is as big as a plum, so not anywhere near a full grown baby. Most experts say that the fetus starts to feel pain at the 20th week (earliest), probably rather 27 weeks. Since were talking about 12 weeks maximum the pain argument is invalid in my opinion. And other than that: Were you concious when you were 12 weeks old? I dont think so. So what else justifies not letting the woman decide in your opinion? Im looking for real answers here, answers that you can explain. And dont bring religion into this please, religion doesnt belong in a topic like this.

It seems to me that the underlying reason they don't support climate change and the current coronavirus quarantine, is because of the proposed government overreach into businesses and people's daily lives.

He has turned out to mostly be your typical standard fare neocon in practice. His rhetoric shifts and is sometimes populist in nature but actions speak stronger than words.

On demographics and culture, the Right has taken a beating these last few years and Trump has done nothing to arrest the slide. In fact I'd say the culture got worse in 3 years of Trump than in the 7 years before him.

Open anti-whiteness, open promotion of degeneracy... the truth is Trump just doesn't care or even if he does, he hasn't done anything about it. Demographics are shifting and the possibility of electing a populist conservative President is dimming by the year.

I think 2024 is our last realistic shot. If Trump does win in 2020 there will not be a Republican elected in 2024. That I can guarantee. If Biden wins, however, cognitively declines and just fails massively, which is likely, we stand a good chance of electing someone like Tom Cotton, Josh Hawley or maaaaybe even Tucker Carlson if he chose to run, in 2024.

I also hear that its quite possible that way more of us have had this bug already and don't even realize it.

I have been lucky in that I can work from home. But my family members can't. I'm also lucky in that I own a few properties, and can house my adult children and not charge them rent during this time. But most people are not so lucky. This shut down is devastating our economy. I'm almost at retirement age now, and with just a little more luck, my wife and I will have a comfortable retirement. But what will be left for my kids?

People say, 'The economy will come back.' But those same people, in the same breath, want to shame and scold those who aren't so sure. People who want to go back to life and work, are screamed and yelled at as almost enemies of humanity. Yet when asked HOW the economy can recover from this...they have no answers. Its all just, 'Stay isolated and don't worry about the economy.' That, frankly, tells me these people don't care about the economy.

I am not convinced this Social Distancing and isolation is a proper response. After the Spanish Flu outbreak, one of the major conclusions was that people tended who spent a lot of time outdoors, tended to not get sick. That the wind made it very hard for the virus to settle on others. Instead it would disperse and dilute. Yet we're forced to stay indoors with our families?

&gt;The Senate Intelligence Committee on Tuesday reaffirmed its support for the U.S. intelligence community’s conclusion that the Russian government interfered in the 2016 presidential election with the goal of putting Donald Trump in the Oval Office. Tuesday's bipartisan report, from a panel chaired by North Carolina Republican Richard Burr, undercuts Trump's years of efforts to portray allegations of Kremlin assistance to his campaign as a ""hoax,"" driven by Democrats and a “deep state” embedded within the government bureaucracy.  
&gt;  
&gt;The intelligence community’s initial January 2017 assessment of Moscow’s influence campaign included “specific intelligence reporting to support the assessment that \[Russian President Vladimir\] Putin and the Russian government demonstrated a preference for candidate Trump,” the committee’s [report](https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/sites/default/files/documents/Report_Volume4.pdf) says. The panel also found “specific intelligence” to support the conclusion that Putin “approved and directed aspects” of the Kremlin’s interference efforts. Senators and committee aides examined everything from the sources and methods used for the intelligence-gathering, to the Kremlin’s actions itself. The 158-page report is heavily redacted, with dozens of pages blacked out entirely. But its final conclusions were unambiguous.  
&gt;  
&gt;The January 2017 assessment found that “Russia’s goals were to undermine public faith in the U.S. democratic process, denigrate Secretary \[Hillary\] Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency. We further assess Putin and the Russian Government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump. We have high confidence in these judgments.”

2,Question about the extent of Pro Life.,"I have had a question for a while and never had anyone to ask. I am not trying to be combative. I really want to know. I assume it will be obvious that I am pro choice but I'm here to listen to other views. I'll try to keep it short but it's a complicated issue. I'm proposing a few scenarios. The first one is long but sets the stage for the following ones. 

1) Lets say I had a O- blood which is the universal donor type. Very important and life saving as it is the only type that can be used when a patient's blood type is unknown and their need it so acute that they do not have time to test the patients BT.

Assuming I didn't already donate as often as safely possible, should it be legal for the gov to compel me to donate? If you think about it, not every O- donation directly saves but many, if not most do. We're not even talking about someone who may or may not be born. We are talking about people with lives, families, and dreams. People hurt who need an emergency transfusion to survive.

Blood donation is an unobtrusive mostly painless procedure with no side effects. If it's OK to force someone to complete a pregnancy to term to save one life, should it be OK to force blood donation to save several lives? Assuming having control over one's body is secondary to protecting life.

2) A parent is needed to perform an emergency blood transfusion to save the life of their teenage child. If the parent refuses should it be legal to force them too? Unlike the above example this is a parent and not a stranger. Similar to the above, the procedure is mostly painless and without side effects. Especially when compared to giving birth. 

3) If forced blood donation is OK. Where is the line drawn? Bone marrow, liver, kidney?

Even in the electoral college, the electors are at this point merely the vehicle through which the people of that state express their will (note that this was not the case in the beginning: the Senate used to be elected by the state legislatures and up until the beginning of Jacksonian democracy the state legislatures in most states told the electors how to vote - South Carolina did this until the Civil War.)

13,Why is the conservative immigration solution always deportation or restricted immigration?,"I ask this because I had a conversation with my father and came to some rather surprising common ground. We talked about the root of the problem regarding immigration and I stated that it was 99% on those who hire illegal immigrants. He agreed and that got us talking about the Republican Party immigration stance. 

See I look at it like this (this metaphor has insects and I am not trying to compare any group of people to insects): if I pour honey all over my kitchen tile I’m going to get ants. If I leave that honey there it doesn’t matter how much ant poison I use or how many I catch; they are going to end up back in my house. The solution is to obviously clean up the damned honey.

Then I see the Conservative party. The party traditionally of both large and small businesses. The two groups that would ultimately benefit from cheap labor. I mean the current president’s career is surrounded by hotel staff, wait staff, and contracting. So it’s hard to believe that people like him would ever truly want to get rid of cheap labor. It seems to me that the easiest and most efficient way to tackle this problem is by cracking down HARD on businesses that hire undocumented workers, but the Conservative party has never and will never do that out of fear of losing a large part of their base (and probably their money). 

At this point it feels like truly solving any immigration issues isn’t something that you should turn to conservatives for. That’s not to say the other option is better, but that simply there is no option, and that conservative ideals conflict very heavily with the concept of getting rid of cheap labor to begin with.

This is in stark contrast with any other president: even George Bush doing his 'clown act' could read a speech. 

I thought maybe it was all in my head, but then I googled it and found a lot of stuff about his reading age and his reading levels. I didn't delve deeper into the many articles about his IQ.

21,How can a classical liberal (like me) support trump at all at this point.,"This is my first general election and I’m excited to vote, even if it is in the bluest star in the country. I don’t really read r/politics, in fact I’ve been so disillusioned with the news that as of late I haven’t really paid attention besides occasionally looking at the AP and sometimes listening to NPR. I just don’t want to paint the picture I’m some leftist never trumpet because I have a lot of conservative views especially when it comes to the free market. However when I look at trump now, recently he said “Liberate such and such states” over the reluctance to heeds trump word over his big push to bring the country back. I’m not saying it’s on easy topic or theirs one answer, and the argument can be made that some states and areas can have limited economic activity, i just think either trump is badly articulating what he actually wants done, or is just generally made a bad judgment call. 

Sometimes a president is judged by his ability to handle a complex and unique problem, a disaster or in this case a once in a lifetime global pandemic. The news is filled with disinformation, so perhaps I’m misinformed about what I’m reading, but since this crisis began, he has completely failed time and time again at handling it in the optimal manner, he sent supplies to China and delayed the reaction over fear over the economic shutdown, unwilling to concede the eventual spread was inevitable despite the fact all the experts already knew what was about to come. The reason is it so much worse in the United States, despite our great medical infrastructure is because we were so slow to respond. Yes the lockdown sucks, but it saves lives. He spread the myth about hydroxychloroquine, not only promoting its ability to cure but encouraging Americans to use it. He’s butted heads under the table with about the only guy who is really enabling consistent leaderships during this outbreak outbreak (Dr Fauci), and his weird nepotism binge continued with his using of Jared Kushner to lead the fight despite him knowing next to nothing about the complexities of medical bureaucracies, and the health field  in general. I’m a big believer in meritocracy, nepotism I thought died 200 years ago.

All of this I could care less about in the grand scheme of things, but the whole squander with trump and the states has really got me thinking about whether he really cares about the functions of government, federalism, democracy , republicanism in general. I’m not saying he wants to be a dictator, but him saying his  “authority is total” and to liberate certain states. Obviously he isn’t pressuring states into opening, but the fact he has the gall to say these things which as a small government classical liberal I find quite disturbing. As much as some Virginians and Michiganders may hate it, their democratic controlled governments were voted by the people, and nobody can say otherwise. Trump doesn’t have total authority over the states, and the fact he says so sparks the very tyrannical characteristics the founders always sought to counter with the branches of government and the electoral system.

&gt; Libertarianism is not conservatism, nor is it an offshoot of conservatism, a subset, or even a relative of common extraction.
&gt; 
&gt; Conservatism, as such, is and must be anathema to libertarianism (at least libertarianism properly understood), because libertarian political philosophy is best understood as a radicalization of traditional liberalism. 
&gt; 
&gt; While this formula is not perfect, both of its components—radical and liberal—suggest the incompatibility of conservatism and libertarianism. The radical, going as she does to the root, hopes to provoke change at the deepest sub strata of society, motivated by the conviction that the political and economic status quo is fundamentally unjust.

It became abundantly clear with the recent democratic nomination process.  MSM would smear or blackout candidates they weren't endorsing and it's no surprise Biden is the nominee.

I'm surprised (but not surprised) at how MSM never praises Trump.  I haven't seen a single article from them suggesting Trump has ever done anything right.  They're always criticizing with blatantly obvious spin.

Now all I see are frustrating clickbait headlines.

I have noticed that American conservatives are considerably more skeptical of Covid-19 and the social distancing measures in place. Here in Québec folks of all political persuasions; including our conservatives are okay with the measures.   


My theory is that the foundations of American conservatism are much more classically liberal (most of your founding fathers were) and individualistic than they are communitarian and classically conservative. 

Here in Québec we aren't lamenting the fact we can't go out and do our stuff. In fact, we've been shown by Google to be the jurisdiction in North America that has changed their habits the most. We are genuinely concerned for our sick, elderly, and vulnerable--and making sure we flatten the curve to make sure our Health Care facilities do not get over-run.   


My American conservative father-in-law in the South is very concerned with all these measures and thinks it is the march of socialism; even though the measures in place are way more lenient than what we've got here and have nothing to do with the workers seizing the means of production.

I don't think we'll see eye-to-eye my Father-in-law and I on this, as I think there is a serious philosophical difference here.

What I can't understand is how adamant other conservatives are on abortion and religion. I think conservatives are some of the smartest people who think realistically, but they believe in something that really has no scientific evidence to support it. I understand the US was founded on christian principles, but why can't those principles and belief in a God be separate? Do conservatives genuinely believe a deity exists and is always watching us in some other dimension (heaven)? That a hell exists and everything in the bible actually happened rather than just being stories? By the law of parsimony, this belief, is in my opinion, far-fetched and pretty bizarre. I don't mean to offend, but I just can't wrap my head around it. If it just serves as a moral code to follow then, yes, I understand, but it doesn't seem that way.

This extends itself to abortion which I think is something completely necessary. Wouldn't banning it cause a huge spike in the population? I'd say most of those who do get one probably shouldn't be reproducing in the first place and would only burden the economy even further. I think we have far too many people as is.

Oh...and I don't wanna wear a face mask, and would really like Baseball to start. In short...I'm having a lot of trouble buying the idea that we must stay away from each other, to this degree. 

I think my anger about this, stems from the vision of hundreds of millions of people, actually asking for a government take-over. This emergency has quickly scared the livin' crap outta most of the public. You turn on the 'idiot-box' or open a paper and all you get is, ""Ahhhhh! We all gonna DIE!!!"" 

What happened to ""We will overcome""? Look, I know good folks are dying. But as I said to my daughter, were I given a choice between dying of this bug, or watching the economy they're gonna have to live in, be totally destroyed, I'd take the bug.

So I ask you, fellow conservatives...is it just me? Am I the only one who thinks this way? Maybe I'm having a psychotic episode or something, but I just can't shake this feeling that most of this is now just a bunch or propagated fear. That this could become the new norm.

For starters, I like to consider myself centrist and I have no problem voting for whichever side I align with. For the last 8 years, it's been Democrat. I like to hear from the other side as much as possible to make sure I'm understanding things correctly.

Now for the question. I recently received a a stimulus check for $1200 (US citizen here) without applying. It just popped into my account. 

A friend of mine later that day posted a thing on Facebook saying that people who receive the stimulus check are ""lazy commies"".

My income tax (that I pay) goes into social services and I fail to see how people accepting the check are at fault at any level. It's coming from my own tax dollars just like social security and defense which I also benefit from. 

Luckily, I dont need unemployment but I also wanted to ask you if you find unemployment in a negative light. Because if I needed it I don't think I would hesitate to apply. 

If I didn't pay my taxes. Then I'd understand that I'm taking from other people. But if im a tax payer I dont see the issue with taking unemployment or the stimulus check.

There are many examples from Trump's presidency, but I see it most recently with the COVID-19 pandemic. I am surprised by how different Trump's approach is to what our governments consider sensible policy, even though the US is leading the world in confirmed cases. And many Republicans seem to support him in what he says as they rail against governors issuing stay-at-home orders, clamor for the economy to be 'opened up' despite the risk of infection, and try to discredit scientific experts who issue guidelines and advice.

In all these things, past and present, it seems very few, if any, Republican politicians or Republican voters openly disagree with these kinds of actions or ideas. Are there any Republicans who disagree openly? Is everyone actually 100% on board all the time? Or is it a question of adhering the party line out of fear?

With this information, including the fact that China has been massively under-reporting their number of confirmed cases, as well as censoring possibly life-saving information about the spread of the virus early in the pandemic, anger is no doubt on the minds of many Americans. I know it’s on mine. Is it too much to demand China pay for what they’ve done? US Senators are already coming up with ways to make China pay, from moving all manufacturing out of China, to direct compensation, there is still no great idea as to how to handle the situation. It’s easy to say “pay!”, but hard to get it done. If we move our manufacturing out of China, there becomes a massive possibility that Europe will move its manufacturing out of the US and closer to the PRC. Prices will drop in China, and possibly skyrocket in the US. We may hurt ourselves more than China. But then again, it’s hard to just sit and watch. Now, around 35,000 American lives have been taken by Chinese gross negligence of the virus. The blood of those Americans is on the hands of the CCP. Will we just sit around? Or will we hold them accountable? This is our Nazi party. The CCP is the true horror of the 21st Century. They harvest Uighur organs by the thousands. They enslave full nations. They take, they pollute; and they destroy. The discrimination is real. The anti-black sentiment is REAL. Not in the US, in THE PRC. When will they receive their Nuremberg trials? We sit idly by while Xi Jinping and his dirty bureaucrats suck the money out of the hard-working people of China.

Consider that renewable energy is, today, a nearly $1 trillion market, and by 2025 is projected to hit [$1.5 trillion](https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/press-release/renewable-energy-market.html).

Consider also that China dominates this market because they've invested into enough R&amp;D that the US simply cannot compete with their products. The only real US contribution to that market is spending the money, buying those panels from China rather than making our own, because we never invested in enough innovation to make a competitive product.

Also, very important to note that the reason China dominates the market is NOT because they exploit cheap labor. [Most of their actual labor to manufacture the panels is automated](https://www.freeingenergy.com/what-is-the-secret-behind-chinas-low-cost-solar-panels/), meaning that labor costs have next to nothing to do with this.

So now with about $10 trillion in Quantitative Easing by the FED in this recent crisis (enough to get a majority stake in the top 500 biggest American company’s) In order to prop up the stock prices so the investors don’t lose money. Our government has proven twice now (This and now 2008 even though 2008 wasn’t even close to this bad of a bail out) that there literally is no risk. 


If you get rid of the illusion and look at it for what it is we have created a nobility class that gets all of the rewards during the good times and then demands us tax payers bail Them out on our dime during the bad times. There is no risk any more. The billionaire class doesn’t add any value to our system anymore if there is 0 risk they are taking on. 


This is literally not capitalism you can not call it that, it is reverse socialism. This is a plutocracy. There are many examples I can use to show this but I feel this one is just so glaring I want to know how you can justify it? To me it’s illogical to say we have anything other then a rich Nobel class now, one that will never has to risk losing because we are forced to pay for it. 


Many people who are conservatives have told me what trump is doing is good and we need to save the investors but 92% of the stock market is owned by the top 20% and 81% is owned by the top 10%. This means we need to save the rich there is no arguing that.

$1200 to half of the country is $180 billion I’m told by conservatives this is also bad even though it’s helps that bottom 80%

So now I have saving top top 20% is good, but spending 1/55th of that amount to save the bottom 80% is bad?

As well as proven reverse socialism (or a plutocracy or socialism for the rich capitalism for the poor) is good?

Also is we HAVE to bail out the investors doesn’t that mean capitalism has failed?

6,Why do conservatives oppose gun control but support stop-and-frisk?," Conservatives always like to call liberals ""gun grabbers"" for supporting things like background checks and waiting periods. Yes these very same people cheer Trump on when he calls for a nationwide stop-and-frisk program to keep crime under control in urban areas. I've seen many conservatives on the internet oppose even the most modest gun reforms and simultaneously praise Trump for his stance on stop-and-frisk. Do these people even know what ""stop-and-frisk"" is? Trump's own words: ""they will stop, they will frisk, and they will take the guns away.""  


Stop-and-frisk is a literal gun confiscation program. Police officers stop people they suspect might be carrying a gun (they match the profile of a murder suspect, usually the color of their skin, and/or they look like they have a gun in their pocket) and they would search their pockets in order to take away their gun. It was implemented in NYC with the intention of trying to confiscate as many guns as possible in order to ensure NYC remained a giant gun-free zone. 66,000 guns were confiscated from law-abiding citizens! It was implemented under the idea that if there are as few guns as possible in the hands of civilians, murders will go down (an idea that conservatives always argue against except for when it comes to stop and frisk). What ever happened to ""guns don't kill people, people kill people :)"" and ""less guns won't keep us more safe"" and ""guns are needed for self-defense"" and ""the second amendment"" and ""the right to bear arms shall not be infringed?""  


Besides mandatory buybacks of AR-15s (which is opposed by most Democratic politicians), none of the Democratic gun control policies call for literal gun confiscation. Yet, conservatives can't stop calling liberals ""gun grabbers."" **Conservatives call liberals ""gun grabbers"" yet support a policy that involves the police literally grabbing guns away from people.** Are you guys ok with stop and frisk because the only people having their guns confiscated are mostly brown and black urbanites? Are you guys admitting that the 2nd amendment should only apply to rural and suburban whites? Stop-and-frisk is literally more anti-gun than anything liberals support.",askaconservative,1586988235

39,How can insurance companies ever be better than a not for profit single payer system?,"I live in Canada where most of our health needs are paid for via taxes and have been discussing this with a relative of mine. My position for USA is to go single payer, his is to fully privatize healthcare and remove regulation, red tape, waste, etc to make insurance plans cheaper and more affordable.

&amp;nbsp;

My question is even if you're able to remove corruption and waste in the insurance industry, how can a for profit insurance company provide a better service than a single payer non profit insurance company?

&amp;nbsp;

If you have a for profit entity sitting between you and your healthcare it will be less efficient and more wasteful than a not for profit entity sitting between you and your healthcare. Smaller insurance companies will also be unable to bargain efficiently due to less volume/demand as a single entity. 10,000x competing insurance comanies with average of 3,300 clients each (330 million Americans divided by 10,000 companies) has less bargaining power than 1 entity with 330m American clients to say ""give me insulin at $0.10/dose or no access to American markets"". If you grant that non profit a monopoly and regulate insurance prices then it will be affordable and more efficient than the for profit agencies precisely because it doesn't have to earn profits. It doesn't matter how cheap you're able to get private insurance plans by cutting red tape, there will always be profits required which bring prices back up?

50,What do you believe are the prospects of Trump winning or losing reelection to Joe Biden this November?,"As of now, Joe Biden is the presumptive Democratic nominee for the 2020 Presidential election and has been endorsed by Bernie Sanders who has recently dropped out.

In the beginning of the year, Trump had higher job approval ratings than ever before and it was looking like he would be able to win 2020 easier than he won 2016 due to economic prosperity and many promises kept.

But since January, things have drastically changed due to the COVID-19 Pandemic worldwide. Now, travel has been heavily restricted, the country is on lock-down and states have ordered stay at home orders and many companies have had major furloughs. Social distancing continues and the unemployment numbers are almost at 20 million.

Meanwhile, the President's job approval rating cratered from 47-49% to 44-45% and his disapproval rating has jumped higher. His approval rating on the handling of the Coronavirus pandemic has fluctuated from being 47% approving and 44% disapproving to 46% disapproving and 43% approving.

Now that Biden is the presumptive nominee, he has gained momentum in national polls. Currently, the RCP Average has Biden 5.9 points ahead of Trump:  *(Biden - 48.9 vs. Trump - 43.0).*

Another thing to keep in mind is that unlike with Hilary Clinton who was a very unpopular candidate, Joe Biden's a much more popular candidate and for the last few months has been polling 50% or above against Trump. However, as of recent, Biden's numbers are no longer 50-52% like they were last month.

Also according to the RCP Average, Biden has a 2-4 point edge over Trump in every single swing state except for Georgia where Trump is leading by 7 and Florida where Biden is only leading against Trump by 0.4 points *(46.7 vs. 46.3).* Meanwhile, Biden continues to lead in Pennsylvania by 3.8 points *(47.3 vs. 43.5)*, Wisconsin by roughly 2.7 points *(46.7 vs. 44.0)* and shockingly Biden is leading Trump in Arizona by 3.8 points *(48.0 vs. 44.2)* and in North Carolina by 3.4 points *(48.7 vs. 45.3).* Aside from Minnesota, Michigan is the swing state where Biden currently polls the strongest, with Biden leading by 4.4 points *(46.2 vs. 41.8).*

These are not good numbers for an incumbent President.

Given the unemployment numbers skyrocketing, America could be headed towards Great Depression II which will be the most devastating in American history. The media no doubt will try to tie this to the President. But what's more is that in the Fall of this year, once the Coronavirus Pandemic has for the most part ended and when the country and its economy reopen, most people won't be thinking about the Coronavirus, but will presumably be thinking about how they don't have a job and are not making money.

Many people may lose their homes because of this too and as with George W. Bush, the people might also blame Donald J. Trump for this economic crisis as well. Especially with the mainstream media peddling it.

On top of all of this, Trump has quite a lot of promise, namely on immigration such as terminating birthright citizenship, halt H1B visas, the wall *(supposed to be concrete, but instead its replacement fencing Obama started)* and end Temporary Protected Status for immigrants. All of which were the what mainly got him elected. Instead, he's singed multiple bills that have resulted in more H1B visa workers coming into America and one of the bills included an amnesty for Liberians here in the U.S. illegally.

The national debt. has also increased under Trump, he never vetoed a single spending legislation *(just as GWB didn't veto a legislation)* and while he got rid of the core mandate for Obamacare, he never fully repealed and replaced it.

While the enthusiasm level among Trump supports is 53% and enthusiasm level among Biden supporters is 24%, this could change with Bernie Sander's endorsement as well as Biden adopting much of Sander's platform and policy agenda. The suburbs in every swing state have shifted significantly into the Democrat column since 2018 as well. Meanwhile, Trump has gained significant support among minority voters, namely Hispanics which he now has an almost 40% approval among them. Trump also has roughly a 20% approval among Black Americans as well. But he's losing more white voters, especially in the suburbs, which is pretty alarming imho.

I'm more of a moderate *(Center-Right to be exact)* voter myself and have voted GOP my whole life. However, I really do have a feeling that Trump and the GOP are going to get blown out this year in a worse manner than what happened in 2018.

What do you all think about this? Could we witness a repeat of 1932 or 1992 this year with Trump losing to Biden this November? Or do you think he'll be reelected despite the odds?

Love them as yourself, as you were foreigners in Egypt. I am the Lord your God."" This is just one of dozens about loving foreigners and treating them well, but I think this one says it the best.

67,Conservative vs Liberal Self-Actualization,"So self actualization is someone discovering, then utilizing their purpose, and then becoming fulfilled. For a long time I found it in opposition to conservative ideals. How can someone discover their purpose/potential if what they are ""allowed"" to do or be is restricted?  Recently I've been reading on more conservative theory/ ideas and I keep seeing it come up.

70,covid conspiracies,"Based on my FB feed (I'm pretty liberal but subscribe to a lot of conservative pages), people think (in no particular order): 

* covid exists but the deaths are overblown 
* covid isn't a big deal when compared to heart disease, cancer, car accidents, flu, etc. 
* covid is caused by 5G towers 
* Bill Gates is trying to kill us with covid vaccinations 
* the WHO is to blame for covid (though covid isn't a big deal anyway?) 
* china is to blame for covid (though covid isn't a big deal anyway?) 
* Trump is doing great but Fauci (who trump seems to be listening to closely) needs to go 
* Trump is doing great but was slowed down (even though he's doing great) by the impeachment
* the shutdown is (outside of a few key locations) overkill, but we should definitely use it to close abortion clinics 

Am I characterizing these viewpoints correctly? Are any of them mutually exclusive? I.e. Can you simultaneously believe that Trump is doing great slowing a pandemic that's not a big deal even though his key advisor is awful? 

Thoughts? And credible sources for more unusual claims we're hearing?",askaconservative,1586716743
71,Isn't the US constitution a fluid document that was meant to be amended and interpreted by the Supreme Court. And wasn't it designed to be a 3rd branch of the government and be politically neutral?,"The original constitution asserted the legality of slavery and that only land owning males could vote. These were changed by amendments. It was amended so that alcohol was illegal and then it was repealed to make alcohol legal again.

 It is my understanding that originally the individual's right to bear arms was not acknowledged by the Supreme Court but only that the states had the right to arm a militia in order to allow each state to protect itself from the possible tyranny of the central government. That's why it's part of the first 10 amendments to the constitution. The first ten amendments were added as a compromise to encourage reluctant states to sign. Isn't the individual right to own arms only protected by the opinion of the current court. The same goes for abortion.",askaconservative,1586713783

73,At what point do conservatives decide that a traditional worldview is no longer a valid worldview?,"There's a saying/joke that goes: ""Ask a progressive a question and if he doesn't have an answer he'll consult the latest scientific research. Ask a conservative and he'll ask his grandmother"". 

If you go back far enough the Jews were polytheists with Yahweh being just one of many gods. So religions change and their worldviews change. 

In 1800 about 80% of Americans were self employed in primarily self sufficient farms and trades. Now 90% of the population are employees. So societies change. 

If the climate changes an animal might adapt by having the ones that could reach the highest branches survive and pass on their genes. That is adaptation. 

When is the time for conservatives to look around and see that some of their ideas are not in touch with the new reality? 

To religious conservatives homosexuality is considered a sin. But new evidence points pretty strongly that sexuality runs on a spectrum from male to female and has a strong basis in our genes. Homosexuality runs in families. If you are a male and you have an uncle who is gay you're more likely to be gay.  The Bible had no problem with polygamy or slavery we have mostly changed our views on that yet many Christians still think that homosexuality is a sin. 

If 90% of the population depends on their livelihood being employed and there is little opportunity to get free land or to compete with the economies of scale of Walmart and Amazon. Isn't one of the causes of homelessness and people dealing in illegal markets is the lack of other opportunities?

In my life time I have seen investors ""rollup"" many segments of the economy from funeral homes, veterinary services to only name a few. I think that part of the conservatism in rural area is that this rollup process hasn't effected smaller communities as much as urban areas. I don't see much reason why this isn't happening to farming.

This isn't what I see though, and mocking the religion itself just seems mean. Personally I'm not religious, and I don't see a reason between wearing a cross or a crystal around your neck.

I ask all this because I have seen the debates that the government does not have the authority to carry out certain measures and I get it, I mostly agree.

&amp;#x200B;

Legal rights assume the existence of a legal system. A legal system assumes the existence of a government. A government assumes the existence of a group. If a contagion were to appear that was worse than anything we can imagine, does a government gain the legitimate authority to force measures that would save as many lives as possible even if they go against previously established law?

# Rules

&gt; This sub exists for non-conservatives to ask conservatives questions about the [definition of conservatism](https://old.reddit.com/r/askaconservative/wiki/conservative), Right-wing politics, conservative theory, traditional values, policy in conservatism, and conservative principles. 
&gt; 
&gt; Conservatives will answer those questions. New conservatives, independents, libertarians, moderates, (polite) liberals and others can then engage in [Socratic dialogue](http://www.criticalthinking.org/pages/the-role-of-socratic-questioning-in-thinking-teaching-learning/522) in order to [understand and explore](http://www.socraticmethod.net/) [conservatism](https://old.reddit.com/r/DebateConservatives/wiki/conservatism).
&gt; 
This is not a sub for people to ""argue"" and ""debate"" in the debased manner as performed on [most of Reddit](https://www.gq.com/story/reddit-thread-ex-neckbeards-self-righteous-nerds) and other social media sites. Those shouting matches are not productive; we aim toward civil discussion of high quality, and we moderate to match.

We call this ""rule zero"" informally: random people come in here and ask questions to figure out the *why* behind what conservatives believe. This is not a debate sub; it is a Q&amp;A sub with a focus on information discussion for the *readers* instead of participation by the *posters*.

You are not equal here. Your contribution is only worthwhile so long as it makes informative, accurate, and interesting reading.

Let us explore our other rules:

&gt; 1. Follow [Reddit site-wide rules](https://old.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy/) and [etiquette](https://old.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette).
&gt; 2. Contributions must be [civil](https://old.reddit.com/r/deep_ecology/wiki/rules-civil), [fact/logic based](https://old.reddit.com/r/deep_ecology/wiki/rules-factual), and [informative](https://old.reddit.com/r/deep_ecology/wiki/rules-informative).
&gt; 3. Contributions must fit our [standards for discussion](https://old.reddit.com/r/askaconservative/comments/6npjbd/how_i_visualize_our_discussions/) and avoid [low effort postings](https://old.reddit.com/r/essential/wiki/guidelines#wiki_3._no_low-quality.2Feffort_posts.2C_including_undescriptive_thread_titles.) and [low-quality sources](https://old.reddit.com/r/askaconservative/wiki/conservative_news). 
&gt; 4. Do not delete topics or comments. 
&gt; 5. No drama. No meta topics in the sub, do not mention other subreddits or link them (/r/example) or invoke users (/u/example).
&gt; 6. Our goal is a sub that [people can read like a magazine](https://www.reddit.com/r/askaconservative/wiki/discussion) and find high-quality informative content on the topic of *why* conservatives believe what they do.
&gt; 7. [Rise above](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHR-rzUjCzU) the [Reddit](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=reddit) [lowest common denominator](http://thisinterestsme.com/things-hate-reddit/) keeping in mind [the Dunning-Kruger effect](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/e320/9ca64cbed9a441e55568797cbd3683cf7f8c.pdf) and [the bell curve](https://www.thoughtco.com/introduction-to-the-bell-curve-3126337) mean [that](http://ieas.unideb.hu/admin/file_7421.pdf) there are [no universal truths, values, or communications](https://www.iep.utm.edu/nihilism/).
&gt; 8. No [tone policing](https://www.thecrimson.com/column/millennial-athwart/article/2016/4/8/stop-tone-policing/) or [concern trolling](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=concern%20troll).

&gt; 9. No [astroturfing](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/astroturfing). You are speaking for conservatism here, not yourself. If you are paid to post here, you must acknowledge that; if you are a Leftist including Libertarian, do not pretend to be conservative; if you also post in any sub that has violated Reddit rules (like [the subs](https://old.reddit.com/r/askaconservative/wiki/brigades/) that have [brigaded](https://www.dailydot.com/news/week-reddit-downvote-brigades-business/) us) you will be banned.
&gt; 10. Do not come here to fight with conservatives, bicker over the latest [gotchas](https://www.thefreedictionary.com/gotchas) from late night comedy, or insert propaganda. We strongly suggest [steelmanning](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Steel_man) any question or response.
&gt; 11. The R. Lee Ermey rule: [""Here you are all equally *worthless*.""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78ICiQKdO-Q) In most subs, you are the client; here, our goal is to uphold Rule Six. Our mod staff includes two PhDs, an LLM, three MAs, and two MBAs and we [value their time](https://old.reddit.com/r/askaconservative/wiki/moderation) over your trivial objections, [maggots](https://i.imgur.com/Nrw8ZtV.jpg).

Rule Six and Rule Eleven form the core; you are here to provide interesting content for others to read. The other rules reflect the usual stuff that people get wrong. It is important to note that many of these things are not a big deal if *you* do them, but then others will imitate, and this will cause a degradation in the quality of discourse.

&gt; If anything here shocks, confuses, offends, triggers, traumatizes, or disturbs you and you have self-destructive thoughts, please [consult this resource](https://www.mentalhealth.gov/get-help/immediate-help).

Some people in the past have reported weeping, uncontrollable rage, and strange sexual fetishes caused by reading this sub. Your caution is advised.

# Recommendations
1. **Expect antagonistic questions.** People are coming here from a consumer-egalitarian bubble in a fog of commercial and media messages. They are going to sometimes ask nasty, ironic, silly, and ""gotcha"" questions. If you filter out the insanity and answer the question as if it were asked by a calm person, you will show someone else the reasoning behind what we do. If you react like a typical Redditor, no one benefits.
2. **Answer for the audience, not the person.** ""All the world's a stage, And all the men and women merely players."" You are not here to answer for you; you are answering for a philosophy and folkway known as [conservatism](https://old.reddit.com/r/askaconservative/wiki/conservative). Address the underlying question and everyone learns the root reasons why you believe what you do.
3. **Reflect on the longest time scale possible.** Intelligent people have low time-preference and high time-awareness. We want intelligent people here. Therefore, answer so that your answer could provide a humanity that lasts for eternity in the best state possible, meaning not just the moral life but the good life.
4. **Mods are unpaid volunteers.** We are janitors for the sub, not your employees. Please do not be Karens and Kevins. We are the ones who hold back the two sources of Reddit, the endless flow of low self-esteem people who will compromise integrity for imagined social approval, and the raging antisocial people who come here to masturbate over their clever verbal cruelty to others. A sane society disenfranchises the former and exiles the latter, but here on Reddit, such people are common. Social media is 95% people with no lives trying to live through the screen and 5% misfits who find most people tedious, desperately search for something of meaning and relevance.
5. **Typical Reddit Behavior (TRB) is pointless.** Please do not come in here and abuse people or repeat tropes. Most social media content is mostly repetition; we would like to be the exception. Please treat others with respect, even if they may not deserve it from what you have seen so far; maybe they just saved a lost puppy before posting something inane and asinine to the sub. Treat people as you would like all people to be treated, which includes recognizing that we are not equal and need to be addressed according to what we know and can know.

# Moderator Note

&gt; I like banning people because it is so much fun - it is more fun than killing wild game in the forest because man is the most dangerous animal of all - to ban something gives me the most thrilling experience - it is even better than getting your rocks off with your fellow mods - the best part of it is that when I die I will be reborn in paradise and all the (people) I have banned will become my slaves - I will not give you my name because you will try to slow down or stop my collecting of slaves for my afterlife. - Ted Cruz, July 31, 1969

96,Gun control measures signed in Virginia seem reasonable to me,"Hi Conservatives,

I am a moderate, a veteran, and a gun owner.  I believe in the second amendment and support the Supreme Court ruling that it is an individual right to own a firearm.

This morning I read the below article in the Philadelphia Inquirer, which read in part: ""**Northam, a Democrat, said Friday that he had signed bills to limit handgun purchases to one per month; establish universal background checks; give authorities the power to temporarily seize weapons from someone deemed a threat; require owners to report lost or stolen firearms within 48 hours; and increase the penalty for recklessly leaving a loaded gun within reach of a child.""**

I don't find any of this controversial, but there was a great deal of backlash to it in Richmond, which may well have softened the measure to what was recently signed.  I don't know what the original proposals were. That said, clearly the definition of ""someone deemed a threat"" should be crystal-clear in the law.

Beyond the slippery-slope argument, what are conservative issues with the five measures cited above?

The element of luck is added by rolling dice and is random. The rules remain the same throughout the game and can't be changed or influenced. Finally there is this a neutral banker who receives and disperses money.

If I were to set up the board game to better reflect our real world economy I'd first have one player to be given say 10 times the amount of money normally received and 50% of all the places on the board. This one player would also have received a special  education in all the nuances of the game, has a group of consultants to help him play, and has special access to and influence to be able to change the rules of the game in his favor.  I'd also have one player who comes to the game owing money and therefore not receiving any money from the banker, with no education and with no influence to effect the rules. The other 2 player would receive what is normally received in the game.

I will probably always prefer Democratic party over Republican party, because, let's say I find them less insane (although considering how they keep making the same mistake over and over again, I could be mistaken). But what bothers me very much about them is how much they want to restrict your gun rights.

Of course banning anything wrong achieve anything. Felons will always get their guns illegally, no matter the laws. But what do you think Democratic-led government could do that you could tolerate?

Some studies suggest a link between economic inequality and virtually every societal ill in the world. So maybe, the government should solve some of those ills, more directly linked to gun violence. Like:

Ensuring everyone having mental Healthcare

Provide nationwide sex education to minimize presence of unwanted children

Promote extensive family planning

Promote and possibly provide drug rehabs

Create strict mental health checks

On top of that, several other policies:

Strict, but easily accessible gun licenses

Promote education about guns in schools

Universal background checks, so nobody unfit to hold a gun will buy one

Emphasize the importance to take on illegal gun trade to make it harder to obtain gun illegally

It's shameful how democrats keep shooting themselves in foot by making gradually more and more stupid remarks about guns, when they can easily get couple million voters who vote Republican on the gun issues alone.

And please, keep in mind that giving more guns to more law abiding citizens is not a solution, because people who want gun control so much are people living in cities where recreational shooting is very low. All they know about guns is what they see in action movies where they're used only to commit crimes and from news where they're also usually linked to crime.

Right? And I also get the sentiment: ""Well it's old, so it must be good."" But then obviously there are things that are old and bad. Like slavery. No one in their right mind wants slavery back. 

Overall what this boils down to. ""I want to keep the good stuff."" There is nothing conservative about that statement. Because the reason is: It is good. ""I want to keep the old stuff."" That is a conservative statement but the conservative part about it is: ""I want to keep the stuff that is old, although it is not good."" 

I don't know. That just does not make any sense to me.

65,What should China's punishment be?,"Lets see, they tried silencing the initial alarm bells. Tried to sweep it under the rug.

Then after letting it proliferate the world, they opened up a bit about it.

Then they started cooking up the numbers and claim they get about 30 new cases a day and have a lower death and infection rate than every western country. This skewed data and threw off a lot of statistical analysis around the world. This also mitigated the seriousness of the issue.

On top of this they have reopened their wet markets where this problem arose from, because they are eating all sort of animals like pangolins, bats, dogs, bloodworms, snakes, cats, etc....

On top of even that they have cost the world unprecedented job loss and economic loss. People around the US have lost a substantial portion of their 401k's and other investments. The cherry on top is that they have started blaming Americans for this entire mess.

One of the primary arguments in favour of gun ownership is as a defence against an unjust or authoritarian government.

So when this new covid-19 relief bill puts trillions of dollars in the hands of corporations without protecting private citizens. What possible justification is there to protect corporations to such a degree?

If, I'll use the airlines as an example were so irresponsible as to leave themselves in danger of collapse at a time like this shouldn't they be required to declare bankruptcy and liquidate? Does the system working as intended not say that capitalism will fill the void, a new private entity will answer the call? When the government bails out private industry is that not the worst part of both capitalism and communism, where the executives take the profits when there is profit to be had and the people shoulder the burden when times are hard? And the same executives have free reign to pay into electoral campaigns, or run for office dictating rules to the same industries they used to work in.

I believe capitalism can work (albeit with heavier regulation than would be popular here) but consistent, reliable bailouts spit in the face of anyone not already a CEO or other wealthy shareholder.

What are the guns for? When the bailouts came in 2008 and Millions of working people still lost their homes? While it's happening again now?

&gt; Within a few months the T4 Program—named for the Chancellery offices that directed it from the Berlin address Tiergartenstrasse 4—involved virtually the entire German psychiatric community. A new bureaucracy, headed by physicians, was established with a mandate to kill anyone deemed to have a “life unworthy of living.” Some physicians active in the study of eugenics, who saw Nazism as “applied biology,” enthusiastically endorsed this program. However, the criteria for inclusion in this program were not exclusively genetic, nor were they necessarily based on infirmity. An important criterion was economic. Nazi officials assigned people to this program largely based on their economic productivity. The Nazis referred to the program’s victims as “burdensome lives” and “useless eaters.”
&gt; 
&gt; The program’s directors ordered a survey of all psychiatric institutions, hospitals, and homes for chronically ill patients. At Tiergartenstrasse 4, medical experts reviewed forms sent by institutions throughout Germany but did not examine patients or read their medical records. Nevertheless, they had the power to decide life or death.
&gt; 
&gt; While the program’s personnel killed people at first by starvation and lethal injection, they later chose asphyxiation by poison gas as the preferred killing technique. Physicians oversaw gassings in chambers disguised as showers, using lethal gas provided by chemists. Program administrators established gas chambers at six killing centres in Germany and Austria: Hartheim, Sonnenstein, Grafeneck, Bernburg, Hadamar, and Brandenburg. The SS (Nazi paramilitary corps) staff in charge of the transports donned white coats to keep up the charade of a medical procedure. Program staff informed victims’ families of the transfer to the killing centres. Visits, however, were not possible. The relatives then received condolence letters, falsified death certificates signed by physicians, and urns containing ashes.",askaconservative,1585571255

She is a moderate liberal who doesn't pay much attention to politics, but knows that I do, and finally asked to hear some of my stances and the reasoning behind them last night. The two issues I focused on were my belief that the second amendment should be entirely without restriction, and that climate change may exist but is entirely over exaggerated by liberal scientists, and that China and India need to be held much more accountable than they are. She was very receptive to everything I stated and said i had even changed her mind on the way she viewed both subjects.

60,Is Fear at the Root of Conservatism?,"When I think about it, I notice that all the differences between conservatives and liberals can be explained by the presence or absence of fear. Conservatives feel afraid about a great many more things than liberals. Mind you, I'm not judging here. Fear can be a rational response. I'm merely commenting on the idea that conservatives are more fearful in general.

Examples of fear in conservative positions:

Immigration - fear of cultural loss, fear of job loss, fear of crime etc.  
Guns - fear that bad things can happen and you need to protect yourself  
Small government - fear of government itself  
Welfare - fear of human nature (pessimism) taking advantage  


Am I correct in thinking that fear is a bedrock of the conservative psych? Imagine for a moment that you were immune to fear. Would you still be conservative?

Once again, I'm not passing judgment on the rationality or irrationality of said fear. I'm just commenting on the presence of it.

It appears that liberals have less fear, and more hope. More optimism about human nature, desire to protect others etc, and this drives most of the differences.",askaconservative,1585316188

In the last two years I’ve learned a lot about myself and thought hard about what my values were and what kind of life I wanted to cultivate for myself and my family if I one day have one.

The deeper I dug the more I drifted towards conservatism, when the whole time I thought “I’m a liberal”. It’s kind of what is shoved in your face in most public school systems.

My family was never wealthy. Parents were immigrants, and despite my dad being an engineer he was the only one working and we were a family of 6 kids.. yeah. So because of all this I thought it was a no brainer I support NOT building the wall or trump, welfare, etc, except it all felt wrong.

I’ve done very well for myself, regardless of having little to no support system, an abusive family environment, and a period of terrible mental health. I believe in working hard and not taking handouts. I generally have faith in people and their ability to thrive.

I still don’t always know what to say when someone asks me what conservatism means to me, so I guess what I’m asking is if anyone can break it down or share what it means for you. What are some general terms/vocab I should be familiar with or know the definitions of (socialism, progressive, etc). Any book recommendations?

I want to make this post because I am not happy with the trend I’ve noticed here, this is one of the only places where I can come on reddit to read and answer questions and provide answers for people, I am in no way discouraging actual discussion about COVID-19 but I’m sick to the death of responding to conspiracy like questions, these aren’t valid questions, you aren’t equal and no I don’t have to look at your post.

I don’t mind discussing COVID-19 but I here it on the radio, see it on my phone, my family talk about it and every subreddit is now rife with it I just don’t want to check on of the highest quality subreddits ive came into contact with to see conspiracy’s or misinformation being spread.

Nonetheless.

•Is Coronavirus the flu?

No, at the best estimates and projections the coronavirus mortality rate is around 1.5%-2.0% the annual flu stands at 0.2-0.6% , the flu disproportionately affects over 65s whereas COVID-19 has caused deaths in 30-65 year olds with underlying conditions.

COVID-19 has a penchant for attacking the lungs and causes viral pneumonia in even lung healthy patients 10% of the time. 

It also has a 5 day incubation whereas the flu is a matter of hours.

•Is coronavirus man made?

No, it’s genetically similar to Chinese horseshoe bat coronavirus nucleotides by 89% and human SARS by about 80% it likely combined with another virus in the wet markets of China as did SARS in 2003 as cross contamination is rampant in these markets, that’s why we segregate and chill meats in the west.

•Is coronavirus a conspiracy to destroy the world economy?

No, destroying the world economy would be impractical for even the most diabolical shadow organization if anything it would benefit an evil organization to have a strong economy and people “consooming” their products and ideas.

•Is this just a plan to keep Donald Trump out of office?

No, not everything in the world is about Donald trump, he did have a good initial plan with the border lockdown but failed to implement testing from other areas and the testing scandal also wasn’t good he was more focused on keeping up the dow points than combating the coronavirus at the start.

Now he is getting serious with the European travel ban and pledging $1k in cash to every citizen.

If anything this stands to Donald trump if he can perform but also you cannot de-platform the president in a state of emergency if this keeps up the elections will likely be postponed until it’s over which could be late 2020 or early 2021. Giving trump more time.

•Is this communist? Is this infringing on my rights?

You live in a society that provides military and police security and public maintenance, federal income supports, national law, protection under employment law etc I could go on.....Ireland, Spain, Italy etc are in lockdown its for the greater good I mean you might be able to survive viral pneumonia but do you want to put a cancer patient? Someone’s great cherished grandmother or a 50 year old war vet with combat induced asthma at risk? Because you wanted to exercise your civil liberties? 

Go for a run, read a book, play some games, spend time with your family.

Isaac Newton created theories to write the foundations of gravity in quarantine from the plagues. 

•Is the COVID-19 the cause of economic downturn?

Probably, most likely but the worlds economy was already heating up. Housing markets in cities around the world are waiting to bust Dublin, Beijing ,California, London etc etc... Brexit, Syrian and Ukrainian War, Trade wars around the globe also threatened this one of the most popular between the USA and China or Russia and EU, the increased flow of the free market whilst also punishing people with taxes and lack of housing was causing the bottom to “slide out”

The Western employment boom was found to be “multi-employment” essentially people working more than one job to meet demands this is what happens in Neo-Liberalism, the bottom of the economy keeps the top running to a point where the top heats up so much the bottom can’t carry it anymore a simple anecdote in my country as an example for this.

Mary works in McDonald’s she’s 24 years of age she makes €10 an hour and lives with her parents the nearest apartment she can afford is a co-habit with 5 people in a cramped house for €900 a month she gets 30 hours a week from McDonald’s, she is earning too much to claim social welfare and universal healthcare but not enough to afford private health insurance or a house or college or anything Mary continues in these situations until something gives and she loses her job.

This is what people mean when they say the “sandwiched middle” and its what caused the 2008 crash because banks where handing people like Mary loans when they knew she couldn’t pay it off sounds trivial but this was a world breaker and it’s cause.

Tax cuts and wild stock markets aren’t the way forward could you imagine deep space travel or colonisations in years and boom busts still happening on earth?

Well the same issue from 12 years ago has reared its head again Neo-Liberal globalisation polices allowing crazy tax cuts and wage slavery leading to a lower and middle class that can’t hold the pressure, it won’t be housing this time it will be something else and that something is the very globalisation we are slave too = Trade wars, wage slavery and COVID-19.

By the way I’m no way calling for socialist-esque economics I’m just stating what causes these crashes people like Mary represent the 40%-60% and get punished the most whilst companies like Apple hide billions around the globe and get away with it, did you know they owe the Irish state $15 billion dollars in unpaid corporate tax and our lovely Neo-liberal government said they can keep the money.

•Is this a left wing conspiracy?

No, it isn’t but in fact you could argue socialism was an indirect cause of the Coronavirus. Maos socialist plans left China reeling for years with famine and the government de-regulated a lot of farming practices especially in the animal foods sector in order to get nourishment levels back up.

This allowed “wet markets” to flourish a wet market is essentially a market with fresh food but in China the relaxed regulations have brought exotic animals to these markets and you have rare animals mixing with known virus and bacteria carriers like bats. The running theory is that COVID—19 was either a mutation of horseshoe bat COV or it was Horseshoe bat COV that made its way to Pangolins and mutated with some form of pangolin virus and then transferred to humans.

1. His  vacations at Mar-a-Lago go into his own pocket. That's kind of corrupt.  If Obama did something similar, the right would (correctly) criticize  him for it.
2. While  the economy has been good under him, this is largely because of a high  deficit. While Obama had a deficit too, it went down every year after  the stimulus package (Trump is proposing something similar now), whereas  Trump just brought it back up. This is not a sustainable economy.
3. He's  very hypocritical. Criticized Obama for taking too many vacations, now  he takes more than him. This is just one example among many.
4. He  dismantled the us pandemic response team and has not had widespread  testing, effectively screwing us over in terms of coronavirus.

* No, it is not helpful to call each other idiots, rednecks, cookie dough eaters, and so on. It may be true but it helps no one.
* Informative, emotionless, and thoughtful answers help us all grow.
* Wash your hands.

Thanks!",askaconservative,1584461077

80,Do you fear the quarantine may end up hurting more people then the virus?,Most of our economy is service driven and we've shut down most services.

I am honestly quite worried about starvation in the US and mass suicides if the quarantine lasts that long.,askaconservative,1584417805

I noticed that some people sympathized with the plight of low-aptitude people, but ultimately didn't think social spending would be any good. I understand this cynicism about social spending, but perhaps maybe the problem is that a lot of social spending is wasted on fabrications like ""equality"" and ""social justice"". If we cut out all that crap, we could instead use the money on early interventions for low-aptitude people as well as perhaps subsides to such people who choose to work.
